<p>It is said of Bergman, that he considered the

of Scheele.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Amongst the numerous services
conferred upon Science by Sir Humphry
Davy, we must not pass unnoticed that kind and
generous patronage which first raised Mr. Faraday
from obscurity, and gave to the chemical world a
philosopher capable of pursuing that brilliant path
of enquiry which the genius of his master had so
successfully explored.</p>

<p>The circumstances which first led Mr. Faraday
to the study of chemistry, and by which he became
connected with the Royal Institution, were
communicated to me, by himself, in the following
letter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO J. A. PARIS, M.D.</p>

<p class="date">Royal Institution, Dec. 23, 1829.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>You asked me to give you an account of my
first introduction to Sir H. Davy, which I am very
happy to do, as I think the circumstances will bear
testimony to his goodness of heart.</p>

<p>When I was a bookseller's apprentice, I was very
fond of experiment, and very averse to trade. It
happened that a gentleman, a member of the Royal
Institution, took me to hear some of Sir H. Davy's
last lectures in Albemarle Street. I took notes, and
afterwards wrote them out more fairly in a quarto
volume.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
My desire to escape from trade, which I thought
vicious and selfish, and to enter into the service of
Science, which I imagined made its pursuers amiable
and liberal, induced me at last to take the bold
and simple step of writing to Sir H. Davy, expressing
my wishes, and a hope that, if an opportunity
came in his way, he would favour my views; at the
same time I sent the notes I had taken at his
lectures.</p>

<p>The answer, which makes all the point of my
communication, I send you in the original, requesting
you to take great care of it, and to let me
have it back, for you may imagine how much I
value it.</p>

<p>You will observe that this took place at the end
of the year 1812, and early in 1813 he requested to
see me, and told me of the situation of assistant in
the Laboratory of the Royal Institution, then just
vacant.</p>

<p>At the same time that he thus gratified my desires
as to scientific employment, he still advised me
not to give up the prospects I had before me, telling
me that Science was a harsh mistress; and, in
a pecuniary point of view, but poorly rewarding
those who devoted themselves to her service. He
smiled at my notion of the superior moral feelings
of philosophic men, and said he would leave me to
the experience of a few years to set me right on that
matter.</p>

<p>Finally, through his good efforts I went to the
Royal Institution early in March of 1813, as assistant
in the Laboratory; and in October of the same
year, went with him abroad as his assistant in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
experiments and in writing. I returned with him
in April 1815, resumed my station in the Royal
Institution, and have, as you know, ever since
remained there.</p>

<p class="signature">I am, dear Sir, very truly yours,<br />
<span class="smcap j8">M. Faraday</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>The following is a note of Sir H. Davy, alluded
to in Mr. Faraday's letter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO MR. FARADAY.</p>

<p class="date">December 24, 1812.</p>

<p class="opening">SIR,</p>

<p>I am far from displeased with the proof you have
given me of your confidence, and which displays
great zeal, power of memory, and attention. I am
obliged to go out of town, and shall not be settled
in town till the end of January: I will then see
you at any time you wish.</p>

<p>It would gratify me to be of any service to you.
I wish it may be in my power.</p>

<p class="signature">I am, Sir, your obedient humble servant,<br />
<span class="smcap j10">H. Davy</span>.</p>
</div>

<p>I must now recall the reader's attention to the
affair of the gunpowder manufactory, to which some
allusion has been already made. It is far from my
wish to intrude upon the public any account of a
private transaction; but the circumstances to which
I must refer are already well known, and I believe,
moreover, that they have been the subject of misrepresentation.</p>

<p>The letters I shall introduce appear to me highly
interesting; and by the warmth of feeling with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
which they repel the bare suspicion of his prostituting
science to the acquisition of wealth, to develope
a feature in his character too important to be
omitted in a memoir of his life.</p>

<p>From the following letter, it would appear that
Davy's alarms, with respect to his responsibilities,
were first awakened by a sight of the labels, in
which his name was introduced.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO JOHN GEORGE CHILDREN, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">Rokeby, July &mdash; 1813.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR CHILDREN,</p>

<p>I am very sorry you did not come to Cobham, as
the party was very pleasant.</p>

<p>Your apparatus was magnificent, worthy an Imperial
Institute: there were some swine however for
the pearls; at least, there was one,&mdash;you cannot
suppose I mean any other than&mdash;&mdash;.</p>

<p>I have been much disturbed and vexed by enquiries
respecting the price of <em>my</em> gunpowder, which
from the labels I find is supposed to be <em>sold</em> by me.
These labels must be altered, so as to put in a clear
point my relations to the manufacture; and it must
be understood by the public that I have given my
gratuitous assistance and advice only.</p>

<p>I have written to Mr. Burton by post, giving two
forms. I shall do you more good if these are adopted
than I can now; and I wish them to be adopted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
speedily, as it may otherwise get abroad that I have
nothing to do with the powder, and that my name
is used in a manner which does not meet my approbation.</p>

<p>In the labels in the windows, it should not be
<em>under my directions</em>, for this implies that I am a
superintendent in the manufactory; but it should
be&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Ramhurst Gunpowder</span>, manufactured by
Messrs. B. C. and Co. In the composition of this
powder, the proprietors have been assisted by the
advice and assistance of Sir H. Davy."</p>

<p>A fair statement will do the manufacture good.
Misapprehension will do it much harm.</p>

<p>I am now at Rokeby; we shall be in a few days
at Braham Castle, Lord Mackenzie's, near Dingwall,
where we shall stay for a week. After that
we shall go to the Marquis of Stafford's, Dunrobin,
near Goldspie.</p>

<p class="center">TO THE SAME.</p>

<p class="date">Edinburgh, July 22.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR CHILDREN,</p>

<p>I wrote to you from Rokeby. I expressed my
feelings respecting the gunpowder. I have been in
extreme harass and anxiety from the idea of the use
of my name, without the proper explanation, and I
certainly expected that no use would have been
made of it without my sanction. I never saw the
label for the canister till it came to me upon one
of them, and I immediately expressed that I was
not satisfied with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
I told Mr. Burton expressly, that in all cases in
which my name was used it must be in my own
way. He is now at the head of your firm; but it
is to <em>you</em>, and not to <em>him</em>, that I have given, and
shall give my assistance.</p>

<p>Every feeling of friendship and affection prompts
my wishes to be useful to you; I have not the same
relations to Mr. Burton.</p>

<p>I am very sorry to give you any trouble on this
business, but I am sure you cannot wish me to remain
in a state of anxiety; and all the friends with
whom I have consulted think it absolutely necessary
for my reputation, that, when my name is used,
a clear statement should be given of the true nature
of the connexion.</p>

<p>I think it will be more useful to you, and increase
your influence and power in the partnership,
if my assistance is stated as given to you, and to
you only&mdash;in this way: "<span class="smcap">Ramhurst Gunpowder</span>,
manufactured by Messrs. Burton, Children, and Co.
after an improved process, founded upon experiments
and investigations made by Sir H. Davy, and communicated
by him to Mr. J. G. Children, under whose
immediate superintendence the gunpowder is made."</p>

<p>I have fully made up my mind on this matter:
and if you approve of the above form, I will state it
to be the only one to which I will consent.</p>

<p>If the gunpowder is called Sir H. Davy's powder,
it must be stated in all cases where my name is used,
that it is so called in honour of my discoveries in
chemistry, and because I have given my gratuitous
assistance in making the experiments and investigations
on which the process is founded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
I have resolved to make no profit of any thing
connected with science. I devote my life to the
public in future, and I must have it clearly understood,
that I have no views of profit in any thing
I do.</p>

<p class="signature">I am, my dear Children,<br />
<span class="j2">Very affectionately yours,</span><br />
<span class="smcap j10">H. Davy</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>In subsequent letters, which it is not necessary
to publish, Davy dwells upon the necessity of his
engagements as a partner being legally cancelled,
as he cannot endure the idea of his philosophical
repose and usefulness being disturbed by the cares
of business, or the trouble of litigation.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to add, that all the parties
concerned in this transaction most readily and cheerfully
met Davy's wishes, all erroneous impressions
were effaced, and the affair was adjusted amicably
and satisfactorily; and he prepared to quit England
with a mind relieved from all the fears and anxieties
which had so unfortunately oppressed it.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>After the Emperor of the French had sternly refused
his passport to several of the most illustrious
noblemen of England, it was scarcely to be expected
that Sir H. Davy would have been allowed
to travel through France, in order to visit the extinct
volcanoes in Auvergne, and afterwards to
examine that which was in a state of activity at
Naples.</p>

<p>No sooner, however, had the discovery of the
decomposition of the alkalies and earths, and its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
probable bearings upon the philosophy of volcanic
action, been represented by the Imperial Institute
to Napoleon, than, with a liberality worthy of the
liberator of Dolomieu, and consistent with his well-known
patronage of science, he immediately and
unconditionally extended the required indulgence.</p>

<p>In consequence of this permission, Sir Humphry
and Lady Davy, the former accompanied by Mr.
Faraday as secretary and chemical assistant, and
the latter by her own waiting-maid, quitted London
on the 13th of October 1813, and proceeded to
Plymouth; at which port they immediately embarked
in a cartel for Morlaix in Brittany.</p>

<p>On landing in France, they were instantly arrested
by the local authorities of the town, who very
reasonably questioned the authenticity of their passports,
believing it impossible that a party of English
should, under any circumstances, have obtained
permission to travel over the Continent, at a time
when the only English in France were detained as
prisoners. They were accordingly compelled to remain
during a period of six or seven days at the
town of Morlaix, until the necessary instructions
could be received from Paris. As soon, however,
as a satisfactory answer was returned, they were set
at liberty; and they reached the French capital on
the evening of the 27th of the same month.</p>

<p>Shortly after his arrival, Davy called upon his old
friend and associate Mr. Underwood, who, although
one of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">détenus</i>, had during the whole war enjoyed
the indulgence of residing in the capital.</p>

<p>The expected arrival of Davy had been a subject
of conversation with the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savans</i> for more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
than a month. Amongst those who were loudest
in his praises, was M. Ampère, who had for several
years frequently expressed his opinion that Davy
was the greatest chemist that had ever appeared.
Whether this flattering circumstance had been communicated
to the English philosopher I have no
means of ascertaining; but Mr. Underwood informs
me that the very first wish that Davy expressed
was to be introduced to this gentleman, whom he
considered as the only chemist in Paris who had
duly appreciated the value of his discoveries; an
opinion which he afterwards took no care to conceal,
and which occasioned amongst the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savans</i> much
surprise, and some dissatisfaction. M. Ampère, at
the time of Davy's arrival, was spending the summer
at a place a few miles from Paris, in consequence
of which the introduction so much desired
was necessarily delayed.</p>

<p>On the 30th he was conducted by Mr. Underwood
to the Louvre. The English philosopher
walked with a rapid step along the gallery, and,
to the great astonishment and mortification of his
friend and <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">cicerone</i>, did not direct his attention to
a single painting; the only exclamation of surprise
that escaped him was&mdash;"What an extraordinary
collection of fine frames!"&mdash;On arriving opposite to
Raphael's picture of the Transfiguration, Mr. Underwood
could no longer suppress his surprise, and in
a tone of enthusiasm he directed the attention of
the philosopher to that most sublime production of
art, and the chef d'&oelig;uvre of the collection. Davy's
reply was as laconic as it was chilling&mdash;"Indeed, I
am glad I have seen it;" and then hurried forward,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
as if he were desirous of escaping from any critical
remarks upon its excellencies.</p>

<p>They afterwards descended to view the statues
in the lower apartments: here he displayed the
same frigid indifference towards the higher works
of art. A spectator of the scene might have well
imagined that some mighty spell was in operation,
by which the order of nature had been reversed:&mdash;while
the marble glowed with more than human
passion, the living man was colder than stone! The
apathy, the total want of feeling he betrayed on
having his attention directed to the Apollo Belvidere,
the Laocoon, and the Venus de Medicis, was
as inexplicable as it was provoking; but an exclamation
of the most vivid surprise escaped him at
the sight of an Antinous, treated in the Egyptian
style, and sculptured in <em>Alabaster</em>.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;"Gracious
powers," said he, "what a beautiful stalactite!"</p>

<p>What a strange&mdash;what a discordant anomaly in
the construction of the human mind do these anecdotes
unfold! We have here presented to us a
philosopher, who, with the glowing fancy of a poet,
is insensible to the divine beauties of the sister arts!
Let the metaphysician, if he can, unravel the mystery,&mdash;the
biographer has only to observe that the
Muses could never have danced in chorus at his
birth.</p>

<p>On the following morning, Mr. Underwood accompanied
him to the Jardin des Plantes, and presented
him to the venerable Vauquelin, who was the
first scientific man he had seen in Paris. On their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
return they inspected the colossal Elephant which
was intended to form a part of the fountain then
erecting on the site of the Bastile. Davy appeared
to be more delighted with this stupendous work than
with any object he saw in Paris: to its architect,
M. Alavair, he formed an immediate attachment.
It has been observed that, during his residence in
this city, his likes and dislikes to particular persons
were violent, and that they were, apparently, not
directed by any principle, but were the effect of
sudden impulse.</p>

<p>In the course of removing the foundations, and
in digging the canal, the subterranean dungeons of
the Bastile were discovered; they were eight in
number, and were called <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Oubliettes</i>. As they
were under the level of the ditch of the fortress,
any attempt to escape from them by piercing the
wall, must have inevitably drowned the unhappy
prisoner together with all those who inhabited the
contiguous cells; one of which was discovered with
the entrance walled up. Upon demolishing this
wall there appeared the skeleton of the last wretched
person who had been thus entombed. In all these
discoveries Davy took the warmest interest.</p>

<p>Upon the construction of the Elephant, he wrote
a letter to M. Alavair, to which I am desirous of
directing the attention of my scientific readers. It
derives its peculiar interest from the opinion which
he at that period entertained upon the subject of
the excitement of Voltaic action by the contact of
different metals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO M. ANTOINE ALAVAIR.</p>

<p class="date">November 1813.</p>

<p class="opening">SIR,</p>

<p>It will give me much pleasure if I can repay
your civility to me by offering any hints that may
be useful in the execution of the magnificent work
constructing under your directions.</p>

<p>Ten parts of copper to one of tin is an excellent
composition for a work upon a great scale, nor do I
believe any proportions can be better.</p>

<p>There is no fear of any decay in the armatures, if
they can be preserved from the contact of moisture;
but if exposed to air and moisture, the presence of
the bronze will materially assist their decay. Wherever
the iron is exposed to air, it should, if possible,
be covered with a thin layer of bronze. When the
iron touches the foundation of <em>lead</em>, it should in
like manner be covered either by lead or bronze.
A contact between metals has no effect of corrosion,
unless a Voltaic circle is formed with moisture, and
then the most oxidable metal corrodes; and iron
corrodes rapidly both with lead and bronze.</p>

<p>The cement which will probably be found the
most durable will be lime, fine sand, and scoria of
iron. The materials should be very fine and intimately
mixed. The ancients always made their
cements for great works some months before they
were used. I have the honour to be, Sir, with
much consideration,</p>

<p class="signature">Your obedient humble servant,<br />
<span class="smcap j10">H. Davy</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>Davy took up his abode at the Hotel des Princes,
Rue Richelieu; whither the principal <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savans</i> of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Paris hastened to pay their respects; which they
did with an alacrity and cheerfulness equalled only
by the courtesy of manner with which they expressed
their congratulations.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of November, Davy attended the
First Class of the Institute, and was placed on the
right hand of the President, who on taking the
chair announced to the meeting that it was honoured
by the presence of "Le Chevalier Davy."</p>

<p>While Davy was at the meeting of the Institute,
a curious adventure occurred to Lady Davy, the
relation of which, by showing the state of surveillance
in which the citizens of Paris were held at
that period, will enable us to appreciate the extent
of the obligation conferred upon Sir Humphry by
the Emperor.</p>

<p>Her Ladyship, attended by her maid, had walked
into the Thuilleries' Garden. She wore a very
small hat, of a simple cockle-shell form, such as was
fashionable at that time in London; while the Parisian
ladies wore bonnets of most voluminous dimensions.
It happened to be a saint's day, on
which, the shops being closed, the citizens repaired
in crowds to the garden. On seeing the diminutive
bonnet of Lady Davy, the Parisians felt little
less surprise than did the inhabitants of Brobdignag
on beholding the hat of Gulliver; and a crowd of
persons soon assembled around the unknown exotic;
in consequence of which, one of the inspectors of
the garden immediately presented himself, and informed
her Ladyship that no cause of '<em>rassemblement</em>'
could be suffered, and therefore requested her
to retire. Some officers of the Imperial Guard, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
whom she appealed, replied, that, however much
they might regret the circumstance, they were
unable to afford her any redress, as the order was
peremptory. She then requested that they would
conduct her to her carriage; an officer immediately
offered his arm, but the crowd had by this time so
greatly increased, that it became necessary to send
for a corporal's guard; and the party quitted the
garden, surrounded by fixed bayonets.</p>

<p>November 3rd, Humboldt and Gay-Lussac paid
their first visit of compliment to Davy.</p>

<p>5th.&mdash;M. Ampère, who came to Paris expressly
for the occasion, was introduced to Davy by Mr.
Underwood, and the two philosophers appeared
equally delighted with each other. Some years
afterwards, however, this feeling of friendly regard,
on the part of Davy, was turned into one of bitter
aversion, in consequence, as it has been supposed,
of certain perfidious insinuations, by which some of
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savans</i>, instigated by feelings of jealousy, had
contrived to prejudice his mind; and which even
led him to exert all his efforts to oppose the election
of Ampère as a foreign member of the Royal
Society.</p>

<p>After Ampère's visit, Mr. Underwood accompanied
Sir H. and his lady to the Imperial Library
in the Rue Richelieu, and afterwards to the Cathedral
of Notre Dame, where they inspected the crown
and imperial regalia. The splendour of the coronation
mantle of Napoleon may be imagined, when
it is stated that its weight exceeded eighty pounds,
and that it was lined with the skins of six thousand
ermines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
6th.&mdash;They visited the Museum of French Monuments,
in the Rue des Petits Augustines, which
contained the tombs and sculptured ornaments preserved
from the churches that were demolished
during the Revolution. This interesting collection,
shortly after the restoration of the Bourbons, was
dispersed. It is a singular fact, that Davy expressed
more admiration at this inferior exhibition
of art, than he did at that of the Greek and Roman
statues in the Museum of the Louvre. Whether
his taste had been vitiated by the inspection of less
perfect models in his earlier days, is a question
which I shall leave more competent judges to
decide.</p>

<p>10th.&mdash;They dined with Count Rumford at
Auteuil, who showed his laboratory to Davy: this
was exactly eight months before the poor brokenhearted
Count sank into the grave, the victim of
domestic torment, and of the persecutions of the
French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savans</i>, instigated by his wife, the widow of
the celebrated Lavoisier.</p>

<p>13th.&mdash;The anniversary dinner of the Philomatic
Society took place on this day, at a restaurateur's
in the Rue St. Honoré; M. Dumeril in the chair.
Although it was very unusual to invite any stranger
upon this occasion, Sir H. Davy and his English
friend were requested to favour the company by
their presence. Thirty-three members were in attendance,
amongst whom were Ampère, Brogniart,
Cuvier, Chevreuil, Dulong, Gay-Lussac, Humboldt,
Thénard, &amp;c.</p>

<p>At this dinner various complimentary toasts were
proposed: and first, the Royal Society of London,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
for which Davy having returned thanks, gave the
Imperial Institute. The Linnæan Society of London,
and the Royal Society of Berlin, were given in
succession. But the circumstance which evinced
the greatest feeling and delicacy towards their English
guest, was the company's declining to drink the
health of the Emperor. It placed their personal
safety even in some jeopardy; and not a little apprehension
was afterwards felt as to how far Napoleon
might resent such a mark of disrespect, for
seven-eighths of the members present were placemen.</p>

<p>November 17th.&mdash;Mr. Underwood states that on
this day he met Humboldt at dinner at Davy's
hotel; and he adds&mdash;"I do not know whether you
are aware that Sir Humphry had a superstitious dislike
at seeing a knife and fork placed crosswise on a
plate at dinner, or upon any other occasion; but I
can assure you that such was the fact; and when it
occurred in the company of his intimate friends, he
always requested that they might be displaced;
whenever this could not be done, he was evidently
very uncomfortable."<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>At about this period, but I am unable to ascertain
the particular day, the junior Chemists, with
Thénard as their leader, gave Davy a sumptuous
dinner at one of the most celebrated restaurateurs in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Paris. The following persons formed a committee
for that purpose: Gay-Lussac, Thénard, Dulong,
Chevreul, Laugier, Robiquet, and Clement. As it
was by the chemists only that this dinner was given,
neither Arago nor Ampère was included; but Berthollet,
Chaptal, and Vauquelin were invited.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 23rd of November,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> M.
Ampère called upon Davy, and placed in his hands
a small portion of a substance which he had received
from M. Clement; and, although it had been in the
possession of the French chemists for more than
twelve months, so entirely ignorant were they of its
true nature and composition, that it was constantly
spoken of amongst themselves as X, the <em>unknown</em>
body.</p>

<p>How far the suggestions of Davy led to the discovery
of the chemical nature of this interesting
substance, which has been since distinguished by
the name of <em>Iodine</em>, is a question which has given
rise to much discussion on the Continent. It has
been moreover questioned, how far the love of science,
and the fervour of emulation, can justify the
interference which Davy is said to have displayed
upon the occasion. He is accused of having unfairly
taken the subject out of the hands of those
who were engaged in its investigation, and to have
anticipated their results.</p>

<p>As his biographer, I feel that it is not only due
to the character of Davy, but essential to the history
of Science, that these questions should be impartially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
examined; and I have spared no pains in
collecting facts for their elucidation. Mr. Underwood,
who was in the constant habit of associating
with the parties concerned in the enquiry, has furnished
me with some important particulars, and his
testimony is fortified by published documents.</p>

<p>The substance under dispute was accidentally discovered
by M. Courtois, a manufacturer of saltpetre
at Paris, but kept secret by him for several years;
at length, however, he communicated it to M.
Clement, who made several experiments on it, but
without any favourable result. On the 23rd of
August 1813, Clement exhibited to Mr. Underwood
the beautiful experiment of raising it into a
violet-coloured vapour, and that gentleman assures
me that this was the only peculiar property which
had at that time been recognised as distinguishing
it. A few days previous to this event, M. Ampère
had received a specimen of the substance, which he
had carefully folded up in paper, and deposited in
his pocket, but on arriving at home, and opening
the packet, he was surprised to find that his treasure
had vanished. Clement, however, furnished him
with another supply, and it was this parcel that
Ampère transferred into the hands of Davy; and
"for which," says Mr. Underwood, "he told me a
few days ago, that Thénard and Gay-Lussac were
extremely angry with him."</p>

<p>The first opinion which the French chemists entertained
respecting the nature of Iodine, was that
it was either a compound of muriatic acid, or of
chlorine, since it formed with silver what appeared
to be a muriate, or a chloride of that metal; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Davy at once observed that the substance so produced
blackened too quickly in the sun to justify
that opinion. He, however, determined to submit
it to a more rigorous examination; and during the
latter part of November he worked upon it at his
hotel with his own apparatus, and on the 3rd of
December in the laboratory of M. Chevreul, at the
Jardin des Plantes, with whom, it may be stated in
passing, he perhaps formed a stricter intimacy than
with any other chemist during his sojourn in Paris.
Chevreul, however, be it known, was a brother of
the angle; and I understand that he still preserves,
as sacred trophies, some artificial flies with which
Davy had supplied him.</p>

<p>Having pointed out the channel through which
Iodine first fell into the hands of Davy, let us pursue
its history. The first public notice of its existence
was read by Clement at the Institute, on the
29th of November 1813. At the meeting of the
6th of December, Gay-Lussac, who had only received
some 'X' a few days previous to this date,
presented a short note, in which he gave the name
of <em>Iode</em> to the body, and threw out a hint as to its
great analogy to chlorine, while he stated that two
hypotheses might be formed as to its nature, that it
might be considered as a simple substance, or as a
compound of oxygen. On the 13th of the same
month, a letter addressed to M. le Chevalier Cuvier,
and dated December 11th, was read from Davy to
the Institute, in which he offered a general view of
its chemical nature and relations;<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and on the 20th
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
of January 1814, he communicated to the Royal Society
of London, a long and elaborate paper, dated
Paris, December 10, 1813, and entitled, "Some
Experiments and Observations on a new Substance,
which becomes a violet-coloured gas by Heat." In
this paper, while the author assigned to Gay-Lussac
all the credit to which his communication of the 6th
of December may be supposed to entitle him, he
evidently felt that some explanation was due to the
chemical world for his having pursued the enquiry.
"M. Gay-Lussac," he observes, "is still engaged in
experiments on this subject, and from his activity
and great sagacity, a complete chemical history of it
may be anticipated. But as the mode of procuring
the substance is now known to the chemical world
in general, and as the combinations and agencies of it
offer an extensive field for enquiry, and will probably
occupy the attention of many persons; and as
the investigation of it is not pursued by the discoverer
himself, nor particularly by the gentlemen
to whom it was first communicated, I shall not hesitate
to lay before the Royal Society an account of
the investigations I have made upon it; and I do
this with the less scruple, as my particular manner
of viewing the phenomena has led me to some new
results, which probably will not be considered by
the Society as without interest in their relation to
the general theory of chemistry, and in their possible
application to some of the useful arts."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
It was not until August 1814, that Gay-Lussac
read his paper on the subject, which was subsequently
published in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Annales de Chimie</i>.</p>

<p>After the above short, but I trust honest statement,
can any reasonable doubt exist, that, if Davy
had not visited Paris, Iodine would have remained
at the end of the year 1814, as it had been for
two preceding years&mdash;the unknown X?</p>

<p>In a communication published in the first volume
of the Royal Institution Journal, Davy offers the
following observations upon this subject: "With
regard to Iodine, the first I had of it was from M.
Ampère, who, before I had seen the substance, supposed
that it might contain a new supporter of
combustion.</p>

<p>"Who had most share in developing the chemical
history of that body, must be determined by a review
of the papers that have been published upon
it, and by an examination of their respective dates.
When M. Clement showed Iodine to me, he believed
that the hydriodic acid was muriatic acid; and M.
Gay-Lussac, after his early experiments, made originally
with M. Clement, formed the same opinion,
and <em>maintained</em> it, when I <em>first</em> stated to him my
belief that it was a new and peculiar acid, and that
Iodine was a substance analogous in its chemical relations
to Chlorine."</p>

<p>I was very desirous of ascertaining the feeling
which at present prevails amongst the French chemists
upon this subject; and I therefore requested
Mr. Underwood to make such enquiries as might
elicit the required information. In a letter from
that gentleman, dated "Paris, August 22, 1830," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
says, "Though Thénard and Gay-Lussac retain
great bitterness of feeling towards Davy, on account
of the affair of Iodine, Chevreul and Ampère are
still, as they ever were, of opinion, that such a feeling
has its origin in a misconception; that what
Davy did, was from the honest desire of promoting
science, and not from any wish to detract from the
merit of the French chemists."</p>

<p>During his visit to Paris, Davy was not introduced
to the Emperor. Lady Davy observed to
me, that, although Sir Humphry felt justly grateful
for the indulgence granted to him as a Philosopher,
he never, for a moment, forgot the duty he
owed his country as a Patriot; and that he objected
to attend the levee of her bitterest enemy. On the
other hand, it is said that Napoleon never expressed
any wish to receive the English chemist; and those
who seek in the depths for that which floats upon the
surface, have racked their imaginations in order to
discover the source of this mysterious indifference;
but I apprehend that we have only to revert to the
political state of Europe in the year 1813, and the
problem will be solved.</p>

<p>Amongst the reasons for supposing that the Emperor
must have felt ill disposed towards the English
philosopher, the following story has been told;
which, as an anecdote, is sufficiently amusing; and
I can state upon the highest authority, that it is
moreover perfectly true.</p>

<p>It is well known that Bonaparte, during his whole
career, was in the habit of personal intercourse with
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savans</i> of Paris, and that he not unfrequently
attended the sittings of the Institute. Upon being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
informed of the decomposition of the alkalies, he
asked, with some impetuosity, how it happened that
the discovery had not been made in France?&mdash;"We
have never constructed a Voltaic battery of sufficient
power," was the answer. "Then," exclaimed Bonaparte,
"let one be instantly formed, without any
regard to cost or labour."</p>

<p>The command of the Emperor was of course
obeyed; and, on being informed that it was in full
action, he repaired to the laboratory to witness its
powers; on his alluding to the taste produced by
the contact of two metals, with that rapidity which
characterised all his motions, and before the attendants
could interpose any precaution, he thrust the
extreme wires of the battery under his tongue, and
received a shock which nearly deprived him of sensation.
After recovering from its effects, he quitted
the laboratory without making any remark, and
was never afterwards heard to refer to the subject.</p>

<p>It is only an act of justice to state that Davy,
during his residence in the French capital, so far
from truckling to French politics, never lost an opportunity
of vindicating with temper the cause of
his own country. At the Théâtre de la Porte Saint
Martin, a melodrame was got up, with the avowed
intention of exposing the English character to the
execration of the audience. Lord Cornwallis was
represented as the merciless assassin of the children
of Tippoo Saib. Davy was highly incensed at the
injustice of the representation, and abruptly quitted
the theatre in a state of great indignation.</p>

<p>Whatever objections might have existed in his
mind, as to his attending a levee of the Emperor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
they did not operate in preventing his being presented
to the Empress at Malmaison; but he could
not be prevailed upon to appear upon that occasion,
in any other than a morning dress; and it was not
until after repeated entreaty, and the assurance that
he would not be admitted into the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de reception</i>,
that he consented to exchange a pair of half-boots
that laced in front, and came over the lower
part of his pantaloons, for black silk stockings and
shoes. His constant answer to the remonstrances of
his friends was, "I shall go in the same dress to
Malmaison as that in which I called upon the Prince
Regent at Carlton House."</p>

<p>The introduction of Sir Humphry and Lady
Davy to the Empress Josephine, took place at Malmaison
on the 30th of November. The only English
present were, the Earl of Beverley, a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">détenue</i>;
General Sir Edward Paget, a prisoner of war, taken
in Spain, and Mr. Underwood; and it was the first
levee at which any of our countrymen had been introduced,
with the exception of Mr. Underwood,
who had been frequently in the habit of paying his
court to the Empress, and to whom, indeed, he was
indebted for those indulgences which have been
already mentioned.</p>

<p>The persons present having arranged themselves
in a semicircle, the Empress entered the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Salle de
reception</i>, and in her usual gracious manner addressed
each individual. After this court ceremony, her
Majesty retired, having previously signified to a
select few, her desire that they should follow her
into the private apartment.</p>

<p>In the Boudoir, the conversation became general,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
and turned upon certain works of art; and upon
Lady Davy expressing, in very florid terms, her
admiration of some beautifully embellished cups
of Porcelain, which were stationed on the mantelpiece,
her Majesty, with that good-nature which
ever distinguished her, immediately presented her
with a specimen.</p>

<p>The Empress then proposed that Lady Davy
should on this occasion visit her conservatories,
upon which it is well known she had lavished large
sums, and was ambitious to be thought to possess
all that was rare and curious. Lady Davy having
expressed some apprehensions as to the coldness of
the day, and appearing to be but thinly clad, one of
the Dames du Palais was commanded to provide
cloaks; and in a short time, Mr. Underwood says,
a <em>mountain</em> of the most costly and magnificent furs,
that probably ever appeared even in a Regal Palace,
were displayed before her; the splendid trophies,
we may conclude, of the Royal conciliation at
Tilsit.</p>

<p>It was on the 13th of December 1813, that Davy
was elected a corresponding member of the First
Class of the Imperial Institute; there were forty-eight
members present, and he had forty-seven
votes: Guyton de Morveau being the only person
who opposed his election.</p>

<p>Nothing ever exceeded the liberality and unaffected
kindness and attention with which the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savans</i> of France had received and caressed the English
philosopher. Their conduct was the triumph
of Science over national animosity,&mdash;a homage to
genius, alike honourable to those who bestowed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
and to him who received it; and it would be an act
of ingratitude, a violation of historical justice, on
the part of the English biographer, did he omit to
express the pride and admiration with which every
philosopher in his country continues to regard it.
It would have been fortunate for the cause of
Science, and fortunate for the historian, could he
have terminated the subject with these remarks;
but the biographer has an act of justice to perform,
which he must not suffer his friendship to evade,
nor his partialities to compromise.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>It would be an act of literary dishonesty to assert
that Sir H. Davy returned the kindness of the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savans</i> of France, in a manner which the friends of
Science could have expected and desired. There
was a flippancy in his manner, a superciliousness
and hauteur in his deportment, which surprised as
much as they offended. Whatever opinions he
might have formed as to the talents of the leading
chemists, it was weakness to betray, and arrogance
to avow them.</p>

<p>He had, by a single blow, fatally mutilated the
system which was the pride and glory of their
nation: it was ungenerous to remind them of his
triumph. It required but little tact to have reconciled
the French philosophers to the revolution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
he had effected; but, unfortunately, that cannot be
said of Davy, which was so wittily observed of Voltaire,&mdash;that
if he trod upon the toes of their prejudices,
he touched his hat at the same time: even
the affair of Iodine, had it been skilfully managed,
would never have left an angry feeling. It was
not his success, but the manner in which he spoke
of it, that rendered it so offensive. He should have
acted according to the judicious advice given to a
member of the clerical profession, upon his consulting
a friend as to the propriety of continuing his
field-sports, should he become a dignitary of the
Church&mdash;"You may hunt, but you must not holla."</p>

<p>It may be supposed that the unguarded conduct
of Davy reached the ear of the Emperor; for in a
conversation with one of the leading members of
the Institute, Napoleon took occasion to observe,
that he understood the young English chemist held
them all in low estimation.</p>

<p>Having thus candidly avowed the errors of Davy,
I may be justified in claiming from the reader his
confidence in the sincerity with which I shall attempt
to palliate them. From my personal knowledge
of his character, I am inclined to refer much
of that unfortunate manner, which has been considered
as the expression of a haughty consciousness
of superiority, to the desire of concealing a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mauvaise
honte</i> and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gaucherie</i>&mdash;an ungraceful timidity, which
he could never conquer. The bashful man, if he
possess strong passions, will frequently force himself
into a state of effrontery, by a violence of effort
which passes amongst ordinary observers for the
sallies of pride, or the ebullitions of temper; whereas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
if, on the contrary, his temperament be cold and
passionless, he will exhibit traits of the most painful
reserve. This proposition cannot, perhaps, be
more forcibly illustrated than by a comparison of
the manners of Davy and Cavendish, whose temperaments
were certainly as much opposed to each
other as fire is to ice: the latter, however, was shy
and bashful, to a degree bordering upon disease;
and nothing so much distressed him as an introduction
to strangers, or as his being pointed out as
a person distinguished in science. On one of the
Sunday evening <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirées</i> of Sir Joseph Banks, he
happened to be conversing with his friend Mr.
Hatchett, when Dr. Ingenhouz, who was rather
remarkable for pomposity of manner, approached
him with an Austrian gentleman in his hand, and
introduced him formally to Mr. Cavendish. He recounted
the titles and qualifications of his foreign
friend at great length, and concluded by saying,
that he had been particularly anxious to be introduced
to a philosopher so universally celebrated
throughout Europe as Mr. Cavendish. As soon as
Dr. Ingenhouz had finished, the Austrian gentleman
began; he assured Mr. Cavendish that one of
his principal inducements in coming to London,
was to see and converse with one whom he considered
the most distinguished chemist of the age.
To all these high-flown addresses, Mr. Cavendish
answered not a single word, but stood with his eyes
cast down upon the floor, in a state of the most
painful confusion. At length, espying an opening
in the crowd, he darted through it with all the
speed he could command, and never stopped until
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
he reached his carriage, which immediately drove
him home.</p>

<p>From the same cause, probably, arose Davy's
inattention and carelessness in those little observances
of etiquette, which many may treat as empty
and unmeaning ceremonials, but which the members
of a polished community regard as the delicate expressions
of feeling, and the language of sentiment.</p>

<p>It is said, that on conversing in the chamber of
the Institute, he received one of its most distinguished
and venerable members, who approached
him with the air of salutation, without rising from
his seat; a circumstance perhaps in itself of very
trifling importance, but it was considered as a mark
of disrespect, which is not readily forgiven, when a
spirit of rivalry may be supposed to sharpen the
affront. It will be remembered that Cæsar might
date his loss of popularity to the fact of his having
received the Senate while sitting in the porch of the
temple of Venus, and that it formed one of the chief
pretences of those who organised the conspiracy
against his person.</p>

<p>There were, besides, other sources of unpopularity,
which we are bound in fairness and candour to
impute to the excellencies, rather than to the defects,
of his character. If we believe with Johnson, that
men have sometimes gained reputation from their
foibles, we may certainly admit the converse of the
proposition, that they have occasionally lost it from
their virtues. Davy, as we have seen, possessed
from his earliest years a frankness of disposition
which endeared him to all his friends, but in after
life it unquestionably exposed him to various annoyances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
which by a little reserve he would have
certainly escaped. It is quite surprising how much
a little mystery, judiciously managed, will achieve.
Seven veils converted the fragment of a tile,
ploughed up in the neighbourhood of Florence,
into an object of awful devotion.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Although it must be admitted that our philosopher
lost some popularity during his visit to the
French metropolis, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savans</i> did not the less respect
his talents, or admire his discoveries. They
appear to have been impressed with the same sentiment
as that which animated Voltaire, when he
asked whether the discovery of Racine's weakness
made the part of Phædra less admirable.</p>

<p>M. Dumas, who is certainly by no means distinguished
for the readiness with which he is disposed
to pay homage to British talent, has declared
that Davy was the greatest chemical genius that
ever appeared.</p>

<p>In fact, the more the researches of this great experimentalist
are studied, the more they must be
admired: every attempt to depreciate their intrinsic
importance will only serve to display their exalted
merits; every attempt to falsify their results will
only tend to demonstrate their accuracy. It is by
an elaborate examination only, that the full evidence
of their truth can be displayed; there are points
which the keen eye of genius will discern, that are
invisible to a grosser sense: the coldness of criticism
then will only make them glow the brighter; like
his own potassium, the contact even of ice, so far
from extinguishing, will light them up in splendour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Sir Humphry left Paris on the morning of the
29th of December, and proceeded by the way of
Lyons to Montpellier, where he remained for a
month, and became acquainted with <span class="smcap">M. Berard</span>,
who afterwards filled the chemical chair in that
university, and in whose laboratory he worked upon
the subject of Iodine, and examined many of the
marine productions of the Mediterranean, with the
view of determining whether they contained that
body. M. Berard directed a considerable quantity
of the species of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ulva</i>, which abounds on the coast
of Languedoc, to be burnt for him; and although
the ashes consisted for the most part of common salt,
he obtained traces of Iodine in the lixivium. From
the general results of his experiments, however, he
concludes, that the ashes of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fuci</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ulvæ</i> of the
Mediterranean afford it in much smaller quantities
than the sea-weed, from which soda is procured; and
it was only in a very few instances that he could
derive any evidence of its existence. In the ashes
of the corallines and sponges, he could not obtain
the slightest indication of its presence. During
this period he also extended his enquiries respecting
the chemical agencies of Iodine, and the properties
of several of its compounds, especially of those in
which he believed it to exist in triple combination
with alkalies and oxygen, and for which he proposed
the name of <em>Oxy-iodes</em>.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>While at Montpellier, Davy witnessed the procession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
of the Pope on his return to Rome. His
Holiness appeared in a state of great humiliation,
and, on being supplicated by a poor woman to cure
her child, he replied, that she must propitiate
Heaven by her prayers, for that he was himself a
mere mortal, without power to heal or to save.</p>

<p>He quitted Montpellier on the 7th of February,
and, accompanied by M. Berard, visited the fountain
of Vaucluse; he afterwards continued his route
to Nice, crossed the Col de Tende, to Turin, and
arrived at Genoa on the 25th of February; from
which place the following letter is dated.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO MR. UNDERWOOD.</p>

<p class="date">Genoa, March 4.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR UNDERWOOD,</p>

<p>I have not received the letter you announced to
me in the street, concerning Ampère's note, nor any
others since I left Paris. The note came to me
through the Prefect of Nice, with an indorsement
by M. Degerand.</p>

<p>I crossed the Alps by the Col de Tende, stayed
at Turin three days, and came here through snow
and ice, over the Bochetta, where I have been waiting
for a fair wind for Tuscany. We have had no
impediments except from the snow and the east
winds.</p>

<p>If you can hear any thing of the destination of
the letters I have twice missed, I shall thank you to
let me know by addressing me at Rome at the
<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">Posta</i>. I shall be most happy to hear some news of
you here, and shall always feel a lively interest in
your plans, and in your welfare.</p>

<p>I have been making some experiments here on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
the Torpedo, but without any decisive results; the
coldness of the weather renders the powers of the
animal feeble; I hope, however, to resume them at
Naples.</p>

<p>Tell M. Ampère, I hope he will not give up the
subject of the laws of the combination of gaseous
bodies, which is so worthy of being illustrated by his
talents, and which offers such ample scope for his
mathematical powers, united as they are with chemical
knowledge:&mdash;tell him also that I hope he will
sometimes write to me, and that I shall always remember
with pleasure the hours I have passed in
his society.</p>

<p>Pray tell me that you are well; and remember me
to all that are interested in me. My wife desires her
kind remembrances. I am, my dear Underwood,</p>

<p class="signature">Your very sincere friend,<br />
<span class="smcap j8">H. Davy</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>Besides researches on the Torpedo, Davy made
farther experiments on the ashes of Sea-weed, which
were collected for him by Professor <span class="smcap">Viviani</span>, of
Genoa.</p>

<p>He left Genoa by water on the 13th, and arrived
at Florence on the 16th of March. Here he worked
in the laboratory of the Academia del Cimento, on
Iodine; but more particularly on the combustion of
the Diamond. The experiments on this latter body
were performed by means of the great lens in the
cabinet of Natural History; the same instrument as
that employed in the first trials on the action of the
solar heat on the diamond, instituted by Cosmo III.
Grand Duke of Tuscany: upon this occasion, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
was assisted by <span class="smcap">Count Bardi</span>, the Director, and
<span class="smcap">Signior Gazzari</span>, the Professor of Chemistry at
the Florentine Museum.</p>

<p>I have been informed that the hasty, and apparently
careless manner in which he conducted his
experiments, and which has been already noticed<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
as being characteristic of his style of manipulation,
greatly astonished the philosophers of Florence, and
even excited their alarm for the safety of the lens,
which on all occasions had been used by them with
such fastidious caution and delicacy.</p>

<p>In the very first trials on the combustion of the
diamond, he ascertained a very curious circumstance
that had not been before noticed; namely, that the
diamond, when strongly ignited by the lens in a
thin capsule of platinum, perforated with many orifices,
so as to admit a free circulation of air, will continue
to burn in oxygen gas after being withdrawn
from the focus. The knowledge of this circumstance
enabled him to adopt a very simple apparatus
and mode of operation in his researches, and to complete
in a few minutes experiments which had been
supposed to require the presence of a bright sunshine
for many hours.</p>

<p>The new facts obtained by the experiments on
Iodine, which he had commenced at Montpellier
and carried on at Florence, he embodied in a memoir,
which was read before the Royal Society on
the 16th of June 1814. It treated more particularly
of the triple compounds containing iodine and oxygen,&mdash;of
the hydrionic acid, and of the compounds
procured by means of it,&mdash;of the combinations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
iodine and chlorine,&mdash;of the action of some compound
gases on iodine,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>&mdash;and, lastly, of the mode
of detecting iodine in combinations. "If iodine,"
he says, "exists in sea water, which there is every
reason to believe must be the case, though in extremely
minute quantities, it is probably in triple
union with oxygen and sodium, and in this case
it must separate with the first crystals of common
salt."</p>

<p>He quitted Florence on the 3rd, and having
visited Sienna, entered Rome on the 6th of April.
The Continent having now become accessible, he
met with many of his English friends: but neither
the extended society by which he was surrounded,
nor the classical attractions of the city of the Cæsars,
allured him from the pursuits of Science. We find
that, shortly after his arrival, he renewed his researches
on the combustion of different kinds of
charcoal, in the laboratory of the Academia del
Lyncei, in which he was assisted by <span class="smcap">Sig. Morrichini</span>
and <span class="smcap">Barlocci</span>, Professors of the College Sapienza
at Rome. Having arranged the results of
this investigation, together with those relating to
the combustion of the diamond, which he had previously
obtained at Florence, he transmitted a paper
to the Royal Society, entitled "Some Experiments
on the Combustion of the Diamond, and other carbonaceous
substances;" which was read on the 23rd
of June, and published in the Second Part of the
Philosophical Transactions for the year 1814.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
No sooner had it been established by various accurate
experiments, that the diamond and common
charcoal consumed nearly the same quantity of oxygen
in combustion, and produced a gas having the
same obvious qualities, than various conjectures were
formed to explain the remarkable differences in the
sensible qualities of these bodies, by supposing some
minute difference in their chemical composition.
MM. Biot and Arrago, from the high refractive
power of the diamond, suspected that it might contain
hydrogen. Guyton Morveau inferred from his
experiments that it was pure carbon, and that charcoal
was an oxide of carbon; whereas Davy was
inclined to believe, from the circumstance of the
non-conducting power of the diamond, as well as
from the action of potassium upon it, that a minute
portion of oxygen might enter its composition,
although such a supposition would be at variance
with the doctrine of definite proportions; but more
lately, in his account of some new experiments on
the fluoric compounds, he hazarded the idea that it
might be the carbonaceous principle combined with
some new and subtile element, belonging to the same
class as oxygen, chlorine, and fluorine, which has
hitherto escaped detection, but which may be expelled,
or newly combined, during its combustion in
oxygen. "That some chemical difference," says
Davy, "must exist between the hardest and most
beautiful of the gems and charcoal, between a nonconductor
and a conductor of electricity, it is scarcely
possible, notwithstanding the elaborate experiments
that have been made on the subject, to doubt: and
it seems reasonable to expect, that a very refined or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
perfect chemistry will confirm the analogies of Nature,
and show that bodies cannot be exactly the
same in composition or chemical nature, and yet
totally different in all their physical properties."</p>

<p>With these impressions, we may readily imagine
the ardour with which he availed himself of the use
of the great lens at Florence. He had in various
ways frequently attempted to fuse charcoal,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> but
without success. In a letter addressed to Mr. Children
is the following passage: "The great result to
be hoped for is the fusion of carbon; and then you
may use diamond in the manufacture of gunpowder."</p>

<p>He tells us that he had long felt a desire to make
some new experiments on the combustion of the
diamond and other carbonaceous substances; and
that this desire was increased by the new fact ascertained
with respect to iodine, which by uniting to
hydrogen, affords an acid so analogous to muriatic
acid, that it was for some time confounded with that
body. His object in these new experiments, was to
examine minutely whether any peculiar matter was
separated from the diamond during its combustion,
and to determine whether the gas, formed in this
process, was precisely the same in its minute chemical
nature, as that formed in the combustion of
common charcoal. By his experiments at Florence,
he satisfactorily accomplished his wishes, and established
beyond a question the important fact, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
"the diamond affords no other substance by its
combustion than pure carbonic acid gas; and that
the process is merely a solution of diamond in
oxygen, without any change in the volume of the
gas."</p>

<p>As one of the principal objects in these researches
was to ascertain whether water was formed during
the combustion of the diamond, with a view to decide
the question of the presence of hydrogen, every
possible source of fallacy was excluded. In one experiment
there was an evident deposition of moisture,
but it was immediately discovered to have been
owing to the production of vapour from a cork connected
with a part of the apparatus, during the
combustion.</p>

<p>In the progress of this research, he ascertained a
fact, the knowledge of which must not only be considered
as important to the present enquiry, but as
highly valuable in excluding error from our reasonings
upon the delicate results of analysis<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>&mdash;I allude
to the extremely minute quantity of water which
becomes perceptible by deposition on a polished
glass surface. He introduced a piece of paper weighing
a grain into a tube of about the capacity of four
cubical inches, the exterior of which was gently
heated by a candle; immediately a slight but perceptible
dew appeared in the interior of the upper
part of the tube; the paper taken out and directly
weighed in a balance, sensible to 1-100th of a grain,
had not suffered any appreciable diminution. If,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
then, on burning 1·84 grains of diamond in oxygen
gas, not even a barely perceptible dew was produced,
we may consider it as fully proved that this
gem cannot contain hydrogen in its composition:
but to render the demonstration, if possible, still
more complete, he kept a small diamond, weighing
·45 of a grain, in a state of intense ignition by the
great lens of the Florentine Museum, for more than
half an hour, in chlorine; but the gas suffered no
change, and the diamond underwent no alteration
either in weight or appearance: now had the smallest
portion of hydrogen been developed, white fumes
of muriatic acid would have been visible, and a certain
condensation of the gas must have taken place.</p>

<p>The general tenor of his results was equally opposed
to the idea of the diamond containing oxygen;
for, in such a case, the quantity of carbonic acid
generated by the combustion, would, on comparison,
have indicated that fact. By combining the carbonic
acid with lime, and then recovering the gas
from the precipitate by muriatic acid, he found its
proportion to be exactly that which was furnished
by an equal weight of Carrara marble similarly
treated.</p>

<p>The enquiry next proceeds to the examination of
other forms of carbonaceous matter, such as plumbago,
charcoal formed by the action of sulphuric
acid on oil of turpentine, and that produced during
the formation of sulphuric ether; and lastly, the
common charcoal of oak.</p>

<p>In all these bodies, he detected the presence of
hydrogen, both by the water generated during their
combustion, and by the production of muriatic acid,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
when ignited in chlorine. The chemical difference
then between the diamond and the purest charcoal,
would appear to consist in the latter containing hydrogen;
but Davy very justly asks whether a quantity
of an element, less in some cases than 1-5000th part
of the weight of the substance, can occasion so great
a difference in physical and chemical characters?
"It is certainly possible," says he, "yet it is contrary
to analogy, and I am more inclined to adopt
the opinion of Mr. Tennant, that the difference depends
upon crystallization." In support of such an
opinion, he farther adduces the fact, that charcoal
after being intensely ignited in chlorine, is not altered
in its conducting power or colour: in which
case the carbon is freed from the hydrogen, and yet
undergoes no alteration in its physical properties.</p>

<p>One distinction supposed to exist between the
diamond and common carbonaceous substance, the
researches of Davy have certainly removed, viz. its
relative inflammability; for he has shown that the
former will burn in oxygen with as much facility as
plumbago.</p>

<p>The experiments, then, which Davy conducted
at Florence and Rome, have removed several important
errors with regard to the nature of carbonaceous
substances; and though they may not encourage
the labours of those speculative chemists
who still hope to illustrate the old proverb,<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> by manufacturing
diamonds out of charcoal, they certainty
show that they are less chimerical than those of the
wild visionaries who sought to convert the baser
metals into gold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
While at Rome, Davy was engaged for several
successive days in the house of Morrichini, for the
purpose of repeating with that philosopher his curious
experiments on <em>magnetisation</em>. Mr. Faraday
was charged with the performance of the experiments,
but never could obtain any results.</p>

<p>On the 8th of May he entered Naples, and remained
there for three weeks, during which period
he visited Mount Vesuvius, and the volcanic country
surrounding it. He describes the crater, at this
time, as presenting the appearance of an immense
funnel, closed at the bottom, with many small apertures
emitting steam; while on the side towards
Torre del Greco, there was a large aperture from
which flame issued to a height of at least sixty yards,
producing a most violent hissing noise. He was
unable to approach sufficiently near the flame to
ascertain the results of the combustion; but a considerable
quantity of steam ascended from it; and
he says, that when the wind blew the vapours upon
him, there was a distinct smell both of sulphurous
and muriatic acids, but there was no indication of
carbonaceous matter from the colour of the smoke;
nor was any deposited upon the yellow and white
saline matter which surrounded the crater, and which
he found to be principally sulphate and muriate of
soda, and in some specimens there was also a considerable
quantity of muriate of iron. At this period,
when the volcano was comparatively tranquil, he
observed the solfaterra to be in a very active state,
throwing up large quantities of steam, and some sulphuretted
hydrogen.</p>

<p>At several subsequent periods he revisited Vesuvius;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
and I shall hereafter take occasion to relate
all the principal observations he made, and the conclusions
at which he arrived, with respect to this
the most interesting of all the phenomena of mineral
nature.</p>

<p>He also took great interest in the excavations at
that time going on at Pompeii, under the direction
of Murat, then King of Naples, who placed at his
disposal several specimens of art, which Davy received
with a view to investigate the chemical composition
of the colours used by the Ancients.</p>

<p>On the 25th of May he returned to Rome, and
again quitted it on the 2nd of June.</p>

<p>I regret to say that the information I have received,
as to the future continental travels of our
philosopher, is extremely meagre, and will consist of
little more than names and dates. Of this, however,
the reader may be assured, that nothing which
relates to his scientific researches has been omitted.</p>

<p>From Rome he proceeded to Terni, and thence to
Bologna, where he remained for three days; then to
Mantua, Verona, and Milan. Whether at this or at
some subsequent period he went to Pavia, in order
to pay his homage to the illustrious Volta, I entertain
some doubt; but the time is immaterial to the
point of the anecdote I am about to relate.</p>

<p>Davy had sent a letter to Pavia to announce his
intended visit; and on the appointed day and hour,
Volta, in full dress, anxiously awaited his arrival.
On the entrance of the great English philosopher
into the apartment, not only in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">déshabille</i>, but in a
dress of which an English artisan would have been
ashamed, Volta started back in astonishment, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
such was the effect of his surprise, that he was for
some time unable to address him.</p>

<p>From Milan, which he left on the 22nd of June,
he went to Como, Domo D'Ossola, and then over
the Simplon, to Geneva, where he arrived on the
25th of that month, and remained until the 18th of
September. During this visit he made various experiments
on Iodine, at the house of De Saussure,
which was situated near the edge of the Lake, and
about three miles from Geneva. He also worked
at M. Pictet's house, on the subject of the heat in
the solar spectrum. Here also he met with a
number of celebrated persons, whose society he
greatly enjoyed; amongst whom were Madame de
Stael, Benjamin Constant, Necker, and Talma.
Lausanne, Vevay, Payerne, Berne, Zurich, Schaffhausen,
and Munich, were successively visited by
him. His route was then continued through Tyrol,
Inspruck, Calmar, Bolsenna, Trent, Bassano,
Vicenza, Padua, to Venice; where having remained
two days, he returned to Padua on the 16th of October,
and then proceeded to Ferrara, Bologna, and
Pietra-Mala; near which latter place, in the Apennines,
he examined a fire produced by gaseous matter
constantly disengaged from a schist stratum, and
from the results of its combustion, he concluded it
to be pure fire-damp. On again reaching Florence,
he found that the Professors had been dismissed,
but he nevertheless resumed his researches, first at
home, and afterwards in the laboratory of the Grand
Duke, where he submitted to analysis some gas
which had been collected by his attendant Mr. Faraday,
from a cavity in the earth, about a mile from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Pietra-Mala, then filled with water, and which from
the quantity of gas disengaged is called <i>Aqua Buja</i>.
It was found to be pure light carburetted hydrogen,
requiring two volumes of oxygen for its combustion,
and producing a volume of carbonic acid gas.
"It is very probable," says he, "that these gases
were disengaged from coal strata beneath the surface,
or from bituminous schist above coal; and at
some future period new sources of wealth may be
opened to Tuscany from this invaluable mineral
treasure."</p>

<p>On the 29th he left Florence, and passing through
Levano, Tortona, and Terni, arrived again at Rome,
on the 2nd of November, where he remained till the
1st of March 1815.</p>

<p>During this winter he was engaged in an elaborate
enquiry into the composition of ancient colours;
and also in experiments upon certain compounds of
iodine and of chlorine. Upon which subjects he transmitted
to the Royal Society three memoirs, viz. one
entitled, "Some Experiments and Observations on
the Colours used in Painting by the Ancients,"
which was read on the 23rd of February; a second,
"On a solid compound of Iodine and Oxygen," read
April 10; and a third, "On the action of Acids on
the Salts usually called Hyper-oxymuriates, and on
the Gases produced from them," read May 4, 1815;
all of which were published in the Philosophical
Transactions for that year.</p>

<p>Although the paintings of the great masters of
Greece have been entirely destroyed, either by accident,
by time, or by the barbarian conquerors at
the period of the decline and fall of the Roman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
Empire, yet there is sufficient proof that this art
attained a very high degree of excellence amongst
a people to whom genius and taste were a kind of
birthright, and who possessed a perception, which
seemed almost instinctive, of the dignified, the
beautiful, and the sublime.</p>

<p>Our philosopher observes, that the subjects of
many of those pictures are described in ancient authors,
and that some idea of the manner and style
of the Greek artists may be gained from the designs
on the vases improperly called "Etruscan," which
were executed by artists of Magna Græcia, and
many of which are probably copies from celebrated
works: of their execution and colouring, some faint
notion may be gained from the paintings in fresco
found at Rome, Herculaneum, and Pompeii; for,
although these paintings are not properly Grecian,
yet at the period when Rome was the metropolis of
the world, the fine arts were cultivated in that city
exclusively by Greek artists, or by artists of the
Greek school; while it is evident, on comparing the
descriptions of Vitruvius and Pliny with those of
Theophrastus, that the same materials for colouring
were employed at Rome and at Athens.</p>

<p>With regard to the nature of these pigments, we
may obtain some information from the works of
Theophrastus, Dioscorides, Vitruvius, and Pliny;
but until the present memoir by Sir H. Davy, no
experimental attempt had been made to identify
them, or to imitate such of them as are peculiar.</p>

<p>His experiments, he informs us, were made upon
colours found in the Baths of Titus, and the ruins
called the Baths of Livia, and in the remains of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
other palaces and baths of ancient Rome, and in the
ruins of Pompeii.</p>

<p>By the kindness of his friend Canova, who was
charged with the care of the works connected with
ancient art in Rome, he was enabled to select, with
his own hands, specimens of the different pigments
that were found in vases discovered in the excavations
made beneath the ruins of the palace of
Titus, and to compare them with the colours fixed
on the walls, or detached in fragments of stucco;
and Signor Nelli, the proprietor of the "Nozze Aldobrandine,"<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
permitted him to make such experiments
upon the colours of that celebrated picture,
as was necessary to determine their nature.</p>

<p>Without entering into the chemical details of the
subject, I shall offer a general history of the nature
of the colours he examined.</p>

<p>Of the red colours, he distinguished four distinct
kinds, viz.&mdash;one bright and approaching to orange,
which he found to be <em>Minium</em>, or the red oxide
of lead; a second, dull red, which he ascertained to
be an iron ochre; a third, a purplish red, which
was likewise an ochre, but of a different tint; and
a fourth, a brighter red than the first, which was
<em>Vermilion</em> or <em>Cinnabar</em>, a sulphuret of mercury. On
examining the fresco paintings in the Baths of
Titus, he found that all the three first colours had
been used, the ochres particularly, in the shades of
the figures, and the minium in the ornaments on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
the borders. The fourth red had been employed in
various apartments, and formed the basis of the
colouring of the niche, and of other parts of the
chamber in which the Laocoon is said to have
been found in the time of Raphael; a circumstance
which Davy considers as being favourable to the
belief that such apartments were intended for Imperial
use, since vermilion, amongst the Romans,
was a colour held in the highest esteem, and was
always one of great costliness.</p>

<p>Of the yellows, the more inferior were mixtures
of ochre and different quantities of chalk; the
richer varieties were ochres mixed with the red
oxide of lead.</p>

<p>The ancients had also two other colours, which
were orange, or yellow; the auripigmentum, or
&#945;&#961;&#963;&#949;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#957;, said to approach to gold in the brilliancy
of its tint, and which is described by Vitruvius as
being found native in Pontus, and which Davy
says was evidently sulphuret of arsenic;&mdash;and a
pale sandarach, said by Pliny to have been found
in gold and silver mines, and which was imitated
at Rome by a partial calcination of cerusse. He
conceives that this must have been <em>Massicot</em>, or the
yellow oxide of lead mixed with minium; I suspect,
however, that Davy was mistaken in supposing
that the ancients always applied the term Sandarach
to minium; the &#931;&#945;&#957;&#948;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#951; of Aristotle was
evidently an arsenical sulphuret.</p>

<p>In his examination of the ancient Frescoes, he
could not detect the use of orpiment; but a deep
yellow, approaching to orange, which covered a
piece of stucco in the ruins near the monument of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Caius Cestius, proved to be oxide of lead, and consisted
of massicot and minium. He considers it
probable that the ancients used many colours from
lead of different tints, between the "<i lang="tr" xml:lang="tr">usta</i>" of Pliny,
which was our minium, and imperfectly decomposed
cerusse, or pale massicot.</p>

<p>The differently shaded blues, by the action of
acids, uniformly assumed the same tint; from which
he concluded that the effect of the base was varied
by different proportions of chalk. This base he ascertained
to be a <em>frit</em>, made by means of soda and
sand, and coloured by oxide of copper.</p>

<p>The greens were, in general, combinations of copper;
and it seemed probable, that although they
appeared in the state of carbonate, they might originally
have been laid on in that of acetate. The
purple of the ancients, the &#960;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#945; of the Greeks,
and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ostrum</i> of the Romans, was regarded as
their most beautiful colour, and was obtained from
shell-fish. Vitruvius states that it was prepared by
beating the fish with instruments of iron, freeing
the purple liquor from the shell containing it, and
then mixing it with a little honey. Pliny says that,
for the use of the painters, <em>argentine creta</em>, (probably
a clay used for polishing silver,) was dyed with it,
and both Vitruvius and Pliny state that it was adulterated,
or imitations of it made by tinging <em>creta</em>
with madder; whence it would appear, that the
ancients were acquainted with the art of making a
lake colour from that plant, similar to the one used
by modern painters.</p>

<p>Pliny informs us, that the finest purple had a tint
like a deep-coloured rose. In the Baths of Titus,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
there was found a broken vase of earthenware,
which contained a pale rose colour; and Davy selected
it as an appropriate subject for his analytical
experiments.</p>

<p>Where this colour had been exposed to the action
of the air, its tint had faded into a cream colour, but
the interior parts retained a lustre approaching to
that of carmine. A diluted acid was found to dissolve
out of it a considerable quantity of carbonate
of lime, with which the colouring principle must
have been mixed, as a substance of a bright rose
colour remained after the process. This colouring
ingredient was proved to contain siliceous, aluminous,
and calcareous earths, without any sensible trace of
metallic matter, except oxide of iron. Upon heating
the substance, first in oxygen, and then with
hyper-oxymuriate of potash, Davy was induced to
consider the colouring matter itself as either of vegetable
or animal origin; the results, however, were
so equivocal, that he renounced the hope of determining
its nature from the products of its decomposition.
If it be of animal origin, he thinks it is most
probably the Tyrian or marine purple, as it is likely
that the most expensive colour would have been
employed in ornamenting the Imperial baths.</p>

<p>He had not observed any colour of the same tint
as this ancient lake in the fresco paintings; the purplish
reds in the Baths of Titus he ascertained to be
mixtures of red ochres and the blues of copper.</p>

<p>The blacks and browns were mixtures of carbonaceous
matter, with the ores of iron or manganese.
The black from the Baths of Titus, as well as that
from some ruins near the Porta del Popolo, deflagrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
with nitre, and presented all the character of
carbon. This fact agrees with the statements of all
the ancient authors who have described the artificial
Greek and Roman black as consisting of carbonaceous
matter, either prepared from the powder of
charcoal, from the decomposition of resin, (a species
of lamp black,) from that of the lees of wine, or from
the common soot of wood fires. Pliny also mentions
the inks of the cuttle-fish, but adds, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex his non fit.</i>"</p>

<p>Davy informs us, that, some years before, he had
examined the black matter of the cuttle-fish, and
had found it to be a carbonaceous substance mixed
with gelatine.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Pliny, moreover, speaks of ivory black invented
by Apelles; of a natural fossil black; and of a black
prepared from an earth of the colour of sulphur.
Davy is of opinion, that both these latter pigments
were ores of iron and manganese; and he observes
that the analysis of some purple glass satisfied him
that the ancients were well acquainted with the ores
of manganese.</p>

<p>The <em>whites</em> which he examined from the Baths of
Titus, as well as those from other ruins, were either
chalk, or fine aluminous clay; and he states that,
amongst all his researches, he never once met with
cerusse.</p>

<p>This interesting account of the colours used by
the ancients is followed by observations on the manner
in which they were applied; and the paper is
concluded with some general remarks of much practical
importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
The azure, he says, of which the excellence is sufficiently
proved by its duration for 1700 years, may
be easily and cheaply imitated: he found, for instance,
that fifteen parts of carbonate of soda, twenty
parts of opaque flint powdered, and three parts of
copper filings, by weight, when strongly heated together
for two hours, yielded a compound substance
of exactly the same tint, and of nearly the same degree
of fusibility; and which, when powdered, produced
a fine deep sky-blue.</p>

<p>The azure, the red and yellow ochres, and the
blacks, appear to have been the only pigments which
have not undergone any change in the fresco paintings.
The vermilion presents a darker hue than
that of recently made Dutch cinnabar; and the red
lead is inferior in tint to that sold in the shops.
The greens are generally dull.</p>

<p>The blue frit above mentioned, he considers as a
colour composed upon the truest principles; and he
thinks there is reason to believe, that it is the colour
described by Theophrastus as the one manufactured
at Alexandria. "It embodies," says he, "the colour
in a composition like stone, so as to prevent the
escape of elastic matter from it, or the decomposing
action of the elements upon it." He suggests the
possibility of making other <em>frits</em>, and thinks it would
be worth while to try whether the beautiful purple
given by oxide of gold could not be made useful in
a deeply tinted glass.</p>

<p>Where <em>frit</em> cannot be employed, he observes that
metallic combinations which are insoluble in water,
and which are saturated with oxygen or some acid
matter, have been proved by the testimony of seventeen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
centuries to be the best pigments. In the red
ochres, for example, the oxide of iron is fully combined
with oxygen and carbonic acid; and the colours
composed of them have never changed. The
carbonates of copper, which consist of an oxide and
an acid, have suffered but little alteration. Massicot
and orpiment, he considers as those which have
been the least permanent amongst all the mineral
colours.</p>

<p>He next takes a view of the colours which owe
their origin to the improvements of modern chemistry.
He considers the <em>patent yellow</em> to be more
permanent, and the chromate of lead more beautiful,
than any yellow possessed by the Greeks or
Romans. He pronounces <em>Scheele's green</em> (arsenite
of copper), and the insoluble muriatic combinations
of copper, to be more unalterable than the
ancient greens; and he thinks that the sulphate of
baryta offers a white far superior to any pigment
possessed by the ancients.</p>

<p>In examining the colours used in the celebrated
Nozze Aldobrandine, he recognised all the compounds
which his analytical enquiries had established:
viz. the reds and yellows were all ochres; the
blues, the Alexandrian frit; the greens, copper; the
purple, especially that in the garment of the Pronuba,
appeared to be a compound colour of red
ochre and copper; the browns and blacks were
mixtures of ochres and carbon; while the whites
were carbonate of lime.</p>

<p>"The great Greek painters," he adds, "like the
most illustrious artists of the Roman and Venetian
school, were probably sparing in the use of the more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
florid tints in historical and moral painting, and
produced their effects rather by the contrasts of
colouring in those parts of the picture where a deep
and uniform tint might be used, than by brilliant
drapery.</p>

<p>"If red and yellow ochres, blacks and whites,
were the pigments most employed by Protogenes
and Apelles, so they are likewise the colours most
employed by Raphael and Titian in their best style.
The St. John and the Venus, in the tribune of the
Gallery at Florence, offer striking examples of pictures
in which all the deeper tints are evidently produced
by red and yellow ochres, and carbonaceous
substances.</p>

<p>"As far as colours are concerned, these works are
prepared for that immortality which they deserve;
but unfortunately, the oil and the canvass are vegetable
materials, and liable to decomposition, and the
last is even less durable than the wood on which the
Greek artists painted their celebrated pictures.</p>

<p>"It is unfortunate that the materials for receiving
those works which are worthy of passing down to
posterity as eternal monuments of genius, taste, and
industry, are not imperishable marble or stone:<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
and that <em>frit</em>, or unalterable metallic combinations
have not been the only pigments employed by
great artists; and that their varnishes have not been
sought for amongst the transparent compounds<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
unalterable in the atmosphere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
In his memoir "On a solid compound of Iodine
and Oxygen," he enumerates, amongst the agencies
of that body, its singular property of forming crystalline
combinations with all the fluid or solid acids.
It will be unnecessary to follow him through this
investigation, since its results have been found to be
erroneous. M. Serullas<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> has lately shown that the
crystalline bodies of Davy are nothing more than
the iodic acid, which being insoluble in acids, is
necessarily precipitated by them.</p>

<p>His paper "On the action of Acids on Salts usually
called Hyper-oxymuriates," announced the important
fact of chlorine forming with oxygen a compound,
in which the latter element exists in a still
greater proportion than in the body previously described
by him under the name of <em>Euchlorine</em>.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>Before finally quitting Italy, he spent three weeks
at Naples, during which period he experimented on
iodine and fluorine in the house of Sementini; he
also paid several visits to Vesuvius, and found the
appearances of the crater to be entirely different from
those which it presented in the preceding year:<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
there was, for instance, no aperture in it; it was
often quiet for minutes together, and then burst out
into explosions with considerable violence, sending
fluid lava, and ignited stones and ashes, to a height
of many hundred feet in the air.</p>

<p>"These eruptions," says he, "were preceded by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
subterraneous thunder, which appeared to come
from a great distance, and which sometimes lasted
for a minute. During the four times that I was
upon the crater, in the month of March, I had
at last learnt to estimate the violence of the eruption
from the nature of the sound: loud and long-continued
subterraneous thunder indicated a considerable
explosion. Before the eruption, the crater
appeared perfectly tranquil; and the bottom, apparently
without an aperture, was covered with
ashes. Soon, indistinct rumbling sounds were
heard, as if at a great distance; gradually, the
sound approached nearer, and was like the noise of
artillery fired under our feet. The ashes then began
to rise and to be thrown out with smoke from the
bottom of the crater; and lastly, the lava and ignited
matter was ejected with a most violent explosion.
I need not say, that when I was standing on
the edge of the crater, witnessing this phenomenon,
the wind was blowing strongly from me; without
this circumstance, it would have been dangerous to
have remained in such a situation; and whenever
from the loudness of the thunder the eruption
promised to be violent, I always ran as far as possible
from the seat of danger.</p>

<p>"As soon as the eruption had taken place, the
ashes and stones which rolled down the crater
seemed to fill up the aperture, so that it appeared
as if the ignited and elastic matter were discharged
laterally; and the interior of the crater assumed
the same appearance as before."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
On the 21st of March, he quitted Naples, and
returned to England by the following route: Rome&mdash;Narni&mdash;Nocere&mdash;Fessombone&mdash;Imola&mdash;Mantua&mdash;(March
30,) Verona&mdash;Pero&mdash;Trente&mdash;Botzen&mdash;Brennah&mdash;Inspruck&mdash;Zirl&mdash;(April

Humphry.</p>

<p>A few months after the return of Sir Humphry
Davy to England, his talents were put in requisition
to discover some remedy for an evil which had
hitherto defied the skill of the best practical engineers
and mechanics of the kingdom, and which
continued to scatter misery and death amidst an
important and laborious class of our countrymen.</p>

<p>To collect and publish a detailed account of the
numerous and awful accidents which have occurred
within the last few years, from the explosion of inflammable
air, or <em>fire-damp</em>, in the coal mines of the
North of England, would present a picture of the
most appalling nature. It appears from a statement
by Dr. Clanny, in the year 1813,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> that, in the space
of seven years, upwards of three hundred pitmen
had been suddenly deprived of their lives, besides a
considerable number who had been severely wounded;
and that more than three hundred women and
children had been left in a state of the greatest
distress and poverty; since which period the mines
have increased in depth, and until the happy discovery
of Davy, the accidents continued to increase
in number.</p>

<p>It may well be asked how it can possibly have
happened that, in a country so enlightened by
science and so distinguished for humanity, an evil
of such fearful magnitude, and of such frequent
recurrence, should for so long a period have excited
but little sympathy, beyond the immediate scene of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
the catastrophe. It would seem that a certain degree
of doubt and mystery, or novelty, is essentially
necessary to create that species of dramatic interest
by which the passions are excited through the medium
of the imagination: it is thus that the philanthropist
penetrates unknown regions, in search of
objects for his compassion, while he passes unheeded
the miserable groups who crowd his threshold; it is
thus that the statesman pleads the injuries of the
Negro with an eloquence that shakes the thrones
of kings, while he bestows not a thought upon the
intrepid labourers in his own country, who for a
miserable pittance pass their days in the caverns of
the earth, to procure for him the means of defying
the severity of winter, and of chasing away the
gloom of his climate by an artificial sunshine.</p>

<p>That the benefits conferred upon mankind by the
labours of Sir H. Davy may be properly appreciated,
it is necessary to describe the magnitude of
the evil which his genius has removed, as well as
the numerous difficulties which opposed his efforts
and counteracted his designs.</p>

<p>The great coal field,<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> the scene of those awful
accidents which will be hereafter described, extends
over a considerable part of the counties of Northumberland
and Durham. The whole surface has
been calculated at a hundred and eighty square
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
miles, and the number of different beds of coal has
been stated to exceed forty; many of which, however,
are insignificant in point of dimensions. The
two most important are about six feet in thickness,
and are distinguished by the names of <em>High main</em>,
and <em>Low main</em>, the former being about sixty fathoms
above the latter.</p>

<p>From this statement, some idea may be formed
of the great extent of the excavations, and of the
consequent difficulty of successfully ventilating the
mines. In some collieries, they are continued for
many miles, forming numerous windings and turnings,
along which the pitmen have frequently to
walk for forty or fifty minutes, before they arrive
at the workings; during which time, as well as
when at work, they have no direct communication
with the surface of the earth. The most ingenious
machinery, however, has been contrived for conducting
pure air through every part of the mine,
and for even ventilating the old excavations, which
are technically called <em>Wastes</em>; and unless some obstruction
occur, the plan<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> so far answers, as to
furnish wholesome air to the pitmen, and to diminish,
although, for reasons to be hereafter stated, it
can never wholly prevent, the dangers of <em>fire-damp</em>;
the nature of which it will be necessary to consider.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
The coal appears to part with a portion of <em>carburetted
hydrogen</em>, when newly exposed to the atmosphere;
a fact which explains the well-known circumstance
of the coal being more inflammable when
fresh from the pit, than after long exposure to the
air. We are informed by the Rev. Mr. Hodgson,
that, on pounding some common Newcastle coal
fresh from the mine, in a cask furnished with a
small aperture, he found the gas which issued from
it to be inflammable; and Davy, on breaking some
lumps of coal under water, also ascertained that they
gave off inflammable gas. The supposition that the
coal strata have been formed under a pressure greater
than that of the atmosphere, may furnish a clue to
the comprehension of this phenomenon.</p>

<p>On some occasions the pitmen have opened with
their picks crevices, or fissures, in the coal or shale,
which have emitted as much as seven hundred hogsheads
of <em>fire-damp</em> in a minute. These <em>Blowers</em>, as
they are technically termed, have been known to
continue in a state of activity for many months, or
even years together;<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> a phenomenon which clearly
shows that the carburetted hydrogen must have existed
in the cavities of the strata in a very highly
compressed, if not actually in a liquid state, and
which, on the diminution of pressure, has resumed
its elastic form.</p>

<p>All the sources of carburetted hydrogen would
appear to unite in the deep and valuable collieries
situated between the great North road and the sea.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Their air courses are thirty or forty miles in length;
and here, as might be expected, the most tremendous
explosions have happened. Old workings, likewise,
upon being broken into, have not unfrequently
been found filled with this gas, and which, by mingling
itself with the common air, has converted the
whole atmosphere of the mine into a magazine of
<em>fire-damp</em>.</p>

<p>On the approach of a candle, it is in an instant
kindled: the expanding fluid drives before it a roaring
whirlwind of flaming air, which tears up every
thing in its progress, scorching some of the miners
to a cinder, and burying others under enormous ruins
shaken from the roof; when thundering to the
shafts, it converts the mine, as it were, into an enormous
piece of artillery, and wastes its fury in a discharge
of thick clouds of coal-dust, stones, and timber,
together with the limbs and mangled bodies of
men and horses.</p>

<p>But this first, though apparently the most appalling,
is not the most destructive effect of these subterraneous
combustions. All the <em>stoppings</em> and trapdoors
of the mine being blown down by the violence
of the concussion, and the atmospheric current
entirely excluded from the workings, such of the
miners as may have survived the discharge are doomed
to the more painful and lingering death of suffocation
from the <em>after-damp</em>, or <em>stythe</em>, as it is termed,
which immediately results from the combustion, and
occupies the vacuum necessarily produced by it.</p>

<p>As the phenomena accompanying these explosions
are always of the same description, to relate the numerous
recorded histories of such accidents would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
only to multiply pictures of death and human suffering,
without an adequate object: it is, however,
essential to the just comprehension of the subject,
that the reader should receive at least one well-authenticated
account, in all its terrific details; and
I have accordingly selected that which was originally
drawn up with much accuracy and feeling by
the Reverend John Hodgson, and which is prefixed
to the funeral sermon preached on the occasion, and
subsequently published by that gentleman.</p>

<p>The accident occurred at Felling Colliery, near
Sunderland, on the 25th of May, in the year 1812.
This mine was considered by the workmen as a
model of perfection, both with regard to the purity
of its air, and the arrangements of its machinery.
The concern was in the highest degree prosperous;
and no accident, except a trifling explosion which
slightly scorched two or three pitmen, had ever
occurred.</p>

<p>Two <em>shifts</em>, or sets of men, were constantly employed,
the first of which entered the mine at four,
and were relieved at their working posts by the next
set at eleven o'clock in the morning; but such was
the confidence of the pitmen in the safety of this
mine, that the second shift of men were often at
their posts before the first set had left them; and
such happened to be the case on the following unhappy
occasion.</p>

<p>About half past eleven, on the morning of the
25th of May, the neighbouring villages were alarmed
by a tremendous explosion. The subterraneous fire
broke forth with two heavy discharges from the
shaft called the '<em>John Pit</em>,' which was one hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
and two fathoms deep, and were almost immediately
followed by one from that termed the '<em>William pit</em>,'
A slight trembling, as if from an earthquake, was
felt for about half a mile around the workings; and
the noise of the explosion, though dull, was heard to
the distance of three or four miles, and greatly resembled
an unsteady fire of infantry.</p>

<p>Immense quantities of dust and small coal accompanied
these blasts, and rose high into the air, in
the form of an inverted cone. The heaviest part of
the ejected matter, such as masses of timber, and
fragments of coal, fell near the pit, but the dust,
borne away by a strong west wind, fell in a continued
shower to the distance of a mile and a half;
and in the village of Heworth, it caused a gloom,
like that of early twilight, and so covered the roads
that the footsteps of passengers were strongly imprinted
on them.</p>

<p>As soon as the explosion had been heard, the
wives and children of the pitmen rushed to the
working pit. Wildness and terror were pictured
in every countenance. The crowd thickened from
every side, and in a very short period several hundred
persons had collected together; and the air
resounded with exclamations of despair for the fate
of husbands, parents, and children.</p>

<p>The machinery having been rendered useless by
the eruption, the rope of the <em>gin</em> was sent down the
shaft with all possible expedition. In the absence of
horses, a number of men, who seemed to acquire
strength as the necessity for it increased, applied
their shoulders to the <em>starts</em>, or shafts of the gin, and
worked it with astonishing expedition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
By twelve o'clock, thirty-two persons, all that
survived this dreadful catastrophe, had been brought
to daylight, but of these three boys lived only a
few hours. The dead bodies of two boys, miserably
scorched and shattered, were also brought up at the
same time. Twenty-nine persons, then, were all
who were left to relate what they had observed of
the appearances and effect of the explosion. One
hundred and twenty-one were in the mine when it
happened, eighty-seven of whom remained in the
workings. Eight persons had fortunately come up
a short time before the accident.</p>

<p>Those who had their friends restored, hastened
with them from the scene of destruction, and for
a while appeared to suffer as much from an excess
of joy, as they had a short time before from the
depth of despair; while those who were yet in
the agony of suspense, filled the air with shrieks
and howlings, and ran about wringing their hands
and throwing their bodies into the most frantic and
extravagant gestures.</p>

<p>As not one of the pitmen had escaped from the
mine by the only avenue open to them, the apprehension
for their safety momentarily increased, and
at a quarter after twelve o'clock, nine persons descended
the John pit, with the faint hope that some
might still survive.</p>

<p>As the fire-damp would have been instantly ignited
by candles, they lighted their way by <em>steel-mills</em>;<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
and knowing that a great number of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
miners must have been at the crane when the
explosion happened, they at once attempted to
reach that spot: their progress, however, was very
soon intercepted by the prevalence of <em>choak damp</em>,
and the sparks from their steel-mill fell into it like
dark drops of blood: deprived therefore of light,
and nearly suffocated by the noxious atmosphere,
they retraced their steps towards the shaft, but they
were shortly stopped by a thick smoke which stood
like a wall before them. Here their steel-mills
became entirely useless, and the chance of their ever
finding any of their companions alive entirely hopeless;
to which should also be added the horror arising
from the conviction of the mine being on fire,
and the probability of a second explosion occurring
at the next moment, and of their being buried in
the ruins it would occasion.</p>

<p>At two o'clock, five of the intrepid persons who
had thus nobly volunteered their assistance, ascended;
two were still in the shaft, and the other two
remained below, when a second explosion, much
less severe, however, than the first, excited amongst
the relatives of those entombed in the mine still
more frightful expressions of grief and despair.
The persons in the shaft experienced but little inconvenience
from this fresh eruption, while those
below, on hearing the distant growlings, immediately
threw themselves flat on their faces, and in
this posture, by keeping a firm hold on a strong
wooden prop, they felt no other annoyance from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
the blast than that of having their bodies tossed in
various directions, in the manner that a buoy is
heaved by the waves of the sea. As soon as the
atmospheric current returned down the shaft, they
were safely drawn to the light.</p>

<p>As each came up, he was surrounded by a group
of anxious enquirers; but not a ray of hope could
be elicited; and the second explosion so strongly
corroborated their account of the impure state of
the mine, that their assertions for the present seemed
to obtain credit. This impression, however, was but
of short duration,&mdash;hope still lingered; they recollected
that persons had survived similar accidents,
and that, upon opening the mine, they had been
found alive after considerable intervals. Three miners,
for instance, had been shut up for forty days
in a pit near Byker, and during the whole of that
period had subsisted on candles and horse-beans.
Persons too were not wanting to agitate the minds
of the relatives with disbelief in the report of the
pitmen who had lately descended to explore the
mine. It was suggested to them, that want of
courage, or bribery, might have induced them to
magnify the danger, and to represent the impossibility
of reaching the bodies of the unfortunate
sufferers. By this species of wicked industry, the
grief of the neighbourhood began to change its
gloomy, for an irritable aspect. The proposition to
exclude the atmospheric air from the mine, in order
to extinguish the fire, was received with the cries
of <em>Murder!</em>&mdash;and with the determination to oppose
such a proceeding by violence.</p>

<p>Many of the widows lingered about the mouth of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
the pit during the whole of the night with the hope
of hearing the cries of a husband or a son.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the 26th, that natural propensity in
the human mind to derive gratification from spectacles
of horror, was exemplified in a very striking
manner. An immense crowd of colliers from
various parts, but more especially from the banks of
the river Wear, assembled around the pit, and were
clamorous in their reproaches of the persons concerned
in the management of the mine, accusing
them of want of perseverance in their attempts to
rescue the unhappy sufferers. Every one had some
successful adventure to relate; all were liberal in
their professions of readiness to give assistance; but
not one was found hardy enough to enter the jaws
of the burning cavern.</p>

<p>The leaders of this outcry, however, who had
been led into error by an impulse which did honour
to their hearts, were soon brought to listen with
patience to a relation of all the circumstances of the
explosion, and of the reasons for concluding that the
mine was then actually on fire, and the persons enclosed
in it beyond the hope of recovery. They
very candidly allowed, after this explanation, the
impracticability of any attempt to reach the bodies
of the sufferers, until the fire was extinguished; and
they accordingly urged the propriety of excluding
from the mine the access of air, as the only means of
accomplishing the object. At the same time, the
proprietors gave the strongest assurances to the multitude,
that if any project could be devised for the
recovery of their friends, no cost or labour should be
spared in executing it; that, if any person could be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
found willing to enter the mine, every facility and
assistance should be afforded him; but, as they were
assured by the most eminent Viewers that the workings
were inaccessible, they would not hold out any
reward for the attempt,&mdash;they would not be accessary
to the death of any one, either by persuasion or
bribery.</p>

<p>At the clamorous solicitation, however, of the
populace, two persons again descended the shaft, and
very nearly lost their lives in the attempt. The report
of these last adventurers, in a great measure,
convinced the people of the impossibility of their
friends' survival in so deadly an atmosphere, and
reconciled them to the plan of excluding the air.
The operation was accordingly commenced, and it
proceeded without interruption; but from various
accidents, more than a month elapsed before the
mine was in a state to admit of examination; and
during this interval, numerous were the idle tales
which had been circulated throughout the country.
Several of the sufferers, it was said, had found their
way to the shafts, and been recovered. Their number
even had been circumstantially told&mdash;how they
had subsisted on candles, oats, and beans, and how
they had heard the different persons who explored
the mine in the hope of rescuing them.</p>

<p>Some conjuror too, it was said, had set his spells
and divinations to work, and had penetrated all the
secrets of the mine. He had discovered one famishing
group receiving drops of water from the roof,
another eating their shoes and clothes, and many
other similar pictures of horror. These inventions
were carefully related to the widows, and they produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
the effect of daily harrowing up afresh their
sorrows; indeed, it seemed the chief employment of
some to indulge in a kind of insane sport with their
own and their neighbours' calamity.</p>

<p>The morning of Wednesday the 8th of July
having been appointed for exploring the workings,
the distress of the neighbourhood was again renewed
at an early hour: a great concourse of people
assembled; some, out of curiosity, to witness the
commencement of an undertaking full of sadness
and danger,&mdash;some to excite the revenge, or to aggravate
the sorrows, of the relatives by calumnies
and reproaches, for the sole purpose of mischief; but
the greater part came with broken hearts and streaming
eyes, in expectation of seeing the mangled
corpse of a father, brother, husband, or son.</p>

<p>The <em>shifts</em> of men employed in this doleful and
unwholesome work were generally about eight in
number. They were four hours in, and eight hours
out of the mine; so that each individual wrought
two shifts every twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>When the first shift of men came up, a message
was dispatched for a number of coffins to be in
readiness at the mouth of the pit. Ninety-two had
been prepared, and they had to pass by the village
of Low Felling, in their way to the mine. As
soon as a cart-load of them was seen, the howling
of the women, who, hitherto secluded in their
dwellings, had now begun to assemble about their
doors, came on the breeze in slow fitful gusts, which
presaged a scene of the greatest distress and confusion.</p>

<p>The bodies were found under various circumstances:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
one miner, from his position, must have
been sleeping when the explosion happened, and
had never opened his eyes. In one spot were found
twenty-one bodies in ghastly confusion,&mdash;some like
mummies, scorched as dry as if they had been
baked; one wanted its head, another an arm&mdash;the
scene was most terrific: the power of the fire was
visible upon all, but its effects were very various;
while some were almost torn to pieces, there were
others who appeared as if they had sunk down overpowered
by sleep.</p>

<p>Every family had made arrangements for receiving
the dead bodies of their kindred; but Dr.
Ramsay having given his opinion, that such a proceeding
might spread a putrid fever through the
neighbourhood, and the first body when exposed
to observation having presented a most horrid and
corrupt appearance, the people very properly consented
to have each body interred as soon as it was
discovered, on condition that the hearse, in its way
to the chapel-yard, should pass by the door of the
deceased.</p>

<p>From the 8th of July to the 19th of September,
the heart-rending scene of mothers and widows examining
the putrid bodies of their sons and husbands,
for marks by which to identify them, was
daily renewed; but very few of them were recognised
by any personal mark&mdash;they were too much
mangled and scorched to retain any of their features:
their clothes, tobacco-boxes, and shoes, were
therefore the only indications by which they could
be identified.</p>

<p>The total loss from this terrible accident was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
ninety-two pitmen; while forty widows, sixty girls,
and twenty-six boys, comprising in all one hundred
and twenty six persons, were thrown upon the benevolence
of the public.</p>

<p>It was impossible that an event of such awful
magnitude should not have deeply affected every
humane person resident in the district. Nothing,
in short, could exceed the anxiety which was manifested
on the occasion; but, most unfortunately,
there existed an invincible prejudice against every
proposition that could be offered, from a general impression
as to the utter hopelessness of any attempt to
discover a remedy. A few philosophic individuals,
however, did form themselves, as we shall presently
learn, into an association for the laudable purpose of
inviting the attention of scientific men to the subject,
and of obtaining from them any suggestions
which might lead to a more secure method of lighting
the mines.</p>

<p>To the Reverend Dr. Gray, the present Lord
Bishop of Bristol, who, at the period to which I
allude, was the Rector of Bishop-Wearmouth, and
one of the most zealous and intelligent members of
the association, I beg to offer my public acknowledgments
and thanks for the several highly interesting
communications and letters with which his
Lordship has obliged me, and by means of which I
have been enabled to present to the scientific world
a complete history of those proceedings which have
so happily led to a discovery, of which it is not too
much to say that it is, at once, the pride of science,
the triumph of humanity, and the glory of the age
in which we live.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
In a letter I had lately the honour of receiving
from that learned prelate, his Lordship says, "It was
at a time when all relief was deemed hopeless, that
Mr. Wilkinson, a barrister in London, and a gentleman
distinguished for the humanity of his disposition,
suggested the expediency of establishing a
society for the purpose of enquiring whether any,
and what, methods of security might be adopted
for the prevention of those accidents so frequently
occurring in the collieries of Northumberland and
Durham.</p>

<p>"In consequence of this benevolent suggestion, a
society was established at Bishop-Wearmouth, on
the 1st of October 1813, by Sir Ralph Milbanke,
afterwards Sir Ralph Noel, Dr. Gray, Dr. Pemberton,
Mr. Robinson, Mr. Stephenson, and several
other gentlemen. It was entitled, 'A Society for
preventing Accidents in Coal-Mines;' and it immediately
obtained the patronage of the Bishop of
Durham, the Duke of Northumberland, and other
noblemen and gentlemen.</p>

<p>"A very few days before the first meeting, twenty-seven
persons had been killed in a colliery in
which Sir Ralph Milbanke had an interest, and he
was called upon at the meeting to state the particulars
of the accident. At that time there was such
little expectation that any means could be devised
to prevent the occurrence of these explosions, that
the object of the gentlemen who convened the
meeting, however humane in principle, was considered
by the persons present as chimerical and visionary.
The Society, however, amidst many difficulties
and considerable discouragement, and a perpetual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
harass by the offer of impracticable schemes
from every quarter, nevertheless persevered in their
meetings, and succeeded in establishing a communication
and correspondence with other Societies in
different parts of the kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
"One of the projects offered was, that electrical
machines should be employed, with ramifications to
extend through all the departments of the collieries,
and which were to be excited in discharging their
fluid in constant succession, in order gradually to
destroy the inflammable air. Many other suggestions
were proposed, the principal of which were
formed with the intention of purifying the air of
the pits by chemical processes, or by forcing in large
quantities of atmospheric air, through pipes and
tunnels, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"The Society, although it received some distinguished
patronage, was not furnished with means
sufficiently ample for exciting emulation by premiums,
or even for defraying the expenses of
intelligent artisans; and it unfortunately lost a
considerable portion of its funds by the failure of
the Wear Bank.</p>

<p>"Amongst the applications which more particularly
excited the attention of the Society, was that
of Mr. Ryan of Donegal, who objected to the principle
upon which the working of collieries was carried
on. He conceived that they should be originally
constructed at the commencement of the working,
with a view to admit the escape of the hydrogen
gas to the highest parts of the colliery. He
proposed to ventilate even the foulest pits, and the
attention of the gentlemen proprietors, or occupiers
of collieries, in the neighbourhood of Newcastle, was
called upon at public meetings, and an enquiry set
on foot with respect to the validity of his pretensions.
Some gentlemen were even deputed to proceed
into Staffordshire to ascertain the nature and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
extent of his services in that county, where he had
been for some time employed. An offer was also
made to place under his management the Hecton
pit, at Hepburn, which was particularly foul; but a
difference of opinion having arisen as to the efficacy
of his plan, he did not consider himself sufficiently
encouraged to proceed, and he left the country dissatisfied.
He afterwards received the gold medal
from the Society for promoting the Arts and
Sciences."</p>

<p>The Society having as yet effected but little towards
the great object of their deliberations, the
chairman of the committee, Dr. Gray, who was
generally acquainted with Sir Humphry Davy,
judged it expedient to direct his attention to a
subject, upon which, of all men of science, he appeared
to be the best calculated to bring his extensive
stores of chemical knowledge to a practical
bearing.</p>

<p>As the life of this valuable man is now closed,
and as every incident in it is interesting as connected
with the advancement of philosophical knowledge,
and especially of chemical discoveries important
to the welfare of mankind, it may be worth
while to enter into a review of the proceedings
which were adopted upon this occasion, in order to
trace the progress of the discoveries which were
made, and the methods by which he arrived at his
conclusions.</p>

<p>Dr. Gray, the chairman of the committee, having
addressed to him a letter with a view to engage him
in an investigation so important to society, received
from him the following answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO THE REVEREND DR. GRAY.</p>

<p class="date">August 3, 1815.</p>

<p class="opening">SIR,</p>

<p>I had the honour of receiving the letter which
you addressed to me in London, at this place, and I
am much obliged to you for calling my attention to
so important a subject.</p>

<p>It will give me great satisfaction if my chemical
knowledge can be of any use in an enquiry so interesting
to humanity, and I beg you will assure the
Committee of my readiness to co-operate with them
in any experiments or investigations on the subject.</p>

<p>If you think my visiting the mines can be of any
use, I will cheerfully do so.</p>

<p>There appears to me to be several modes of destroying
the fire-damp without danger; but the difficulty
is to ascertain when it is present, without introducing
lights which may inflame it. I have thought
of two species of lights which have no power of inflaming
the gas which is the cause of the fire-damp,
but I have not here the means of ascertaining whether
they will be sufficiently luminous to enable the
workmen to carry on their business. They can be
easily procured, and at a cheaper rate than candles.</p>

<p>I do not recollect any thing of Mr. Ryan's plan:
it is possible that it has been mentioned to me in
general conversation, and that I have forgotten it.
If it has been communicated to me in any other
way, it has made no impression on my memory.</p>

<p>I shall be here for ten days longer, and on my return
South, will visit any place you will be kind
enough to point out to me, where I may be able to
acquire information on the subject of the coal gas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
Should the Bishop of Durham be at Auckland, I
shall pay my respects to his Lordship on my return.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, dear Sir, with much respect,
your obedient humble servant,</p>

<p class="opening">SIR,</p>

<p>I received your letter, which followed me to
the Moors, where I have been shooting with Lord
Somerville. I should have replied to it before this
time, but we were in a part of the Highlands where
there was no post. I am very grateful to you for
the obliging invitation it contains.</p>

<p>I propose to leave the Tweed side on Tuesday or
Wednesday, so that I shall be at Newcastle either
on Wednesday or Thursday. If you will have the
kindness to inform me by a letter, addressed at the
Post Office, where I can find the gentleman you

my power to assist the investigation in that neighbourhood.</p>

<p>I regret that I cannot say positively whether I
shall be at Newcastle on Wednesday or Thursday;
for I have some business at Kelso which may detain
me for a night, or it may be finished immediately.</p>

<p>I am travelling as a bachelor, and will do myself

The gentleman alluded to in the preceding letter,
and to whom Dr. Gray wished Sir H. Davy to apply,
was Mr. Buddle, a person whose extensive practical
knowledge has justly entitled him to be considered
as the highest authority on all subjects connected
with the art of mining, and who has conferred
inestimable benefits on the mining interests
by the introduction of successful methods of ventilation.
The account of his interview with Sir H.
Davy is communicated in the following letter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">MR. BUDDLE TO DR. GRAY.</p>

<p class="date">Wall's-end Colliery, August 24, 1815.</p>

<p class="opening"><span class="smcap">SIR</span>,</p>

<p>Permit me to offer my best acknowledgments
for the opportunity which your attention to the
cause of humanity has afforded me of being introduced
to Sir Humphry Davy.</p>

<p>I was this morning favoured with a call from him,
and he was accompanied by the Rev. Mr. Hodgson.
He made particular enquiries into the nature of the
danger arising from the discharge of the inflammable
gas in our mines. I shall supply him with a
quantity of the gas to analyze; and he has given
me reason to expect that a substitute may be found
for the steel mill, which will not fire the gas. He
seems also to think it possible to generate a gas, at a
moderate expense, which, by mixing with the atmospheric
current, will so far neutralize the inflammable
air, as to prevent it firing at the candles of
the workmen.</p>

<p>If he should be so fortunate as to succeed in
either the one or the other of these points, he will
render the most essential benefit to the mining interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
of this country, and to the cause of humanity
in particular.</p>

<p>I have little doubt but it will be gratifying to
you to be informed, that progress is making towards
the establishment of a permanent fund for the relief
of sufferers by accident and sickness in the collieries
of this district.</p>

<p>I have the pleasure to remain, with great respect,
Sir, your most obedient, humble servant,</p>

<p>Sir H. Davy on his return to London, having
been supplied by Mr. Buddle with various specimens
of <em>fire-damp</em>, proceeded, in the first instance,
to submit to a minute chemical examination the
substance with which he had to contend.</p>

<p>In less than a fortnight, he informed Dr. Gray by
letter, that he had discovered some new and unexpected
properties in the gas, which had led to no
less than four different plans for lighting the mines
with safety.</p>

<p>As it was the consequence of your invitation that
I endeavoured to investigate the nature of the fire-damp,
I owe to you the first notice of the progress
of my experiments.</p>

<p>My results have been successful far beyond my
expectations. I shall enclose a little sketch of my
views on the subject; and I hope in a few days to
be able to send a paper with the apparatus for the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
I trust the <em>Safe lamp</em> will answer all the objects
of the collier.</p>

<p>I consider this at present as a <em>private</em> communication.
I wish you to examine the lamps I have had
constructed, before you give any account of my
labours to the committee.</p>

<p>I have never received so much pleasure from the
result of any of my chemical labours; for I trust
the cause of humanity will gain something by it.</p>

<p>I beg of you to present my best respects to Mrs.

<p class="opening"><span class="smcap">MY DEAR SIR</span>,</p>

<p>I sent yesterday a sketch of my results on the
fire-damp. We have lately heard so much of East<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>

<p>I could not find any body to frank it, and you

which I hope may be useful to humanity.</p>

<p>If my letter has not reached you, it will be found
at the Post Office, East Shields.</p>

<p>With respects to Mrs. Gray, I am, my dear Sir,
very sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">H. Davy.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
The sketch alluded to in the foregoing letter, has
been kindly placed in my hands by the Bishop of
Bristol; it possesses considerable interest as an original
document, displaying his earliest views, and
tending to illustrate the history of their progress.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>"The fire-damp I find, by chemical analysis, to
be (as it has been always supposed) a hydro-carbonate.
It is a chemical combination of hydrogen gas
and carbon, in the proportion of 4 by weight of hydrogen
gas, and 11-1/2 of charcoal.</p>

<p>"I find it will not explode, if mixed with less
than six times, or more than fourteen times its volume
of atmospheric air. Air, when rendered impure
by the combustion of a candle, but in which
the candle will still burn, will not explode the gas
from the mines; and when a lamp or candle is made
to burn in a close vessel having apertures only above
and below, an <em>explosive mixture</em> of gas admitted
<em>merely enlarges</em> the light, and then gradually extinguishes
it without explosion. Again,&mdash;the gas
mixed in any proportion with common air, I have
discovered, <em>will not explode</em> in a <em>small tube</em>, the diameter
of which is less than 1/8th of an inch, or even a
larger tube, if there is a mechanical force urging the
gas through this tube.</p>

<p>"Explosive mixtures of this gas with air require
much stronger heat for their explosion than mixtures
of common inflammable gas.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Red-hot charcoal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
made so as not to flame, if blown up by a mixture
of the mine gas and common air, does not explode
it, but gives light in it; and iron, to cause the
explosion of mixtures of this gas with air, must be
made <em>white</em>-hot.</p>

<p>"The discovery of these curious and unexpected
properties of the gas, leads to several practical methods
of lighting the mines without any danger of
explosion.</p>

<p>"The first and simplest is what I shall call the
<em>Safe lamp</em>, in which a candle or a lamp burns in a
safe lantern which is air-tight in the sides, which
has tubes below for admitting air, a chamber above,
and a chimney for the foul air to pass through; and
this is as portable as a common lantern, and not
much more expensive. In this, the light never
burns in its full quantity of air, and therefore is
more feeble than that of the common candle.</p>

<p>"The second is the <em>Blowing lamp</em>. In this, the
candle or lamp burns in a close lantern, having a
tube below of small diameter for admitting air,
which is thrown in by a small pair of bellows, and a
tube above of the same diameter, furnished with a
cup filled with oil. This burns brighter than the
simple safe lamp, and is extinguished by explosive
mixtures of the fire-damp. In this apparatus the
candle may be made to burn as bright as in the air;
and supposing an explosion to be made in it, it cannot
reach to the external air.</p>

<p>"The third is the <em>Piston lamp</em>, in which the candle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
is made to burn in a small glass lantern furnished
with a piston, so constructed as to admit of air
being supplied and thrown into it without any communication
between the burner and the external air:
this apparatus is not larger than the steel-mill, but
it is more expensive than the other, costing from
twenty-two to twenty-four shillings.</p>

<p>"These lamps are all extinguished when the air
becomes so polluted with fire-damp as to be explosive.</p>

<p>"There is a fourth lamp, by means of which any
<em>blowers</em> may be examined in air in which respiration
cannot be carried on: that is, the <em>Charcoal lamp</em>.
This consists of a small iron cage on a stand, containing
small pieces of <em>very well burnt</em> charcoal blown
up to a red heat. This light will not inflame any
mixtures of air with fire-damp.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>"Of these inventions, the <em>Safe lamp</em>, which is
the simplest, is likewise the one which affords the
most perfect security, and requires no more care
or attention than the common candle, and when the
air in mines becomes improper for respiration, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
extinguished, and the workmen ought immediately
to leave the place till a proper quantity of atmospheric
air can be supplied by ventilation.</p>

<p>"I have made many experiments on these lamps
with the genuine fire-damp taken from a blower in
the Hepburn Colliery, collected under the inspection
of Mr. Dunn, and sent to me by the Reverend
Mr. Hodgson. My results have been always unequivocal.</p>

<p>"I shall immediately send models of the different
lamps to such of the mines as are exposed to danger
from explosion; and it will be the highest gratification
to me to have assisted by my efforts a cause
so interesting to humanity."</p>

</div>

<p>Contrary to the wish expressed by Sir Humphry
Davy, the foregoing communication was inadvertently
read at a public meeting of the Coal-trade,
which was held at Newcastle on the 3rd of November:
a circumstance which occasioned some embarrassment
at the time, but is satisfactorily explained
in the following letter from Sir Humphry.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO THE REVEREND DR. GRAY.</p>

<p class="date">23, Grosvenor Street, Dec. 14, 1815.</p>

<p class="opening"><span class="smcap">MY DEAR SIR</span>,</p>

<p>My communication to &mdash;&mdash; was, like that I
made to you, intended to be <em>private</em>; he has however
written to me to apologize for having made
it known at Newcastle, stating, that having seen a
notice of my results in the paper, the motive, as he
conceived, for withholding it was at an end, as he
considered my only reason for wishing to keep back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
my results from the public eye was the conviction
that they might be rendered more perfect, and this
I have now fully proved.</p>

<p>I trust I shall be able in a very few days to send
you a model of a lantern nearly as simple as a common
glass lantern, and which <em>cannot</em> communicate
explosion to the fire-damp. I will send another to
Newcastle, and I will likewise send you the copy
of my paper, which you may reprint in any form
you please; you will find my acknowledgments to
you publicly stated.</p>

<p>My principles are these: <em>First</em>, a certain mixture
of azote and carbonic acid prevents the explosion
of the fire-damp, and this mixture is necessarily
formed in the safe lantern;&mdash;<em>Secondly</em>, the fire-damp
<em>will not explode</em> in tubes or feeders of a certain
small diameter. The ingress into, and egress of
air from my lantern is through such tubes or feeders;
and therefore, when an explosion is <em>artificially</em>
made in the safe lantern, it does not communicate
to the external air.</p>

<p>I have made two or three lanterns of different
forms. Experience must determine which will be
the most convenient.</p>

<p>Should there be a little delay in sending them,
it will be the fault of the manufacturer. It is impossible
to conceive the difficulty of getting any
thing made in London which is not in the common
routine of business; and I should be very sorry to
send you any thing imperfectly executed.</p>

<p>With best respects to Mrs. Gray, I am, my dear Sir,</p>

<p class="signature">Very sincerely your obliged servant,<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
The paper alluded to in the preceding letter, entitled,
"On the Fire-damp of Coal Mines, and on
methods of lighting the mine so as to prevent its
explosion," was read before the Royal Society on
the 9th of November, 1815.</p>

<p>In this memoir he communicates the results of
some chemical experiments upon the nature of the
fire-damp, and announces the existence of certain
properties in that gas, which had previously escaped
observation, and which leads to very simple methods
of lighting the mines without danger.</p>

<p>He confirms the opinion of Dr. Henry, and
other chemists, as to the fire-damp being light carburetted
hydrogen gas, and analogous to the inflammable
gas of marshes; but he found that the
degree of its combustibility differed most materially
from that of the other common inflammable gases,
which it is well known will explode by the contact
of both red-hot iron and charcoal; whereas well-burned
charcoal, ignited to the strongest red heat,
did not explode any mixture of the air and of the
fire-damp; and a fire made of well-burned charcoal,
that is to say, of charcoal that will burn without
flame, was actually blown up to whiteness by an
explosive mixture containing the fire-damp without
producing its inflammation.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> An iron rod also, at
the highest degree of <em>red</em> heat, and even at the common
degree of <em>white</em> heat, did not inflame explosive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
mixtures of the fire-damp; but when in brilliant
combustion, it produced the effect.</p>

<p>He moreover found that the heat produced by
the combustion of the fire-damp was much less than
that occasioned by most other inflammable gases
under similar circumstances; and hence its explosion
was accompanied with comparatively less expansion:
a circumstance of obvious importance in
connection with the propagation of its flame.</p>

<p>Numerous experiments were likewise instituted
by him with a view to determine the proportions of
air with which the fire-damp required to be mixed,
in order to produce an explosive atmosphere; and
he found the quantity necessary for that purpose to
be very considerable; even when mixed with three
or nearly four times its bulk of air, it burnt quietly
in the atmosphere, and extinguished a taper. When
mixed with between five and six times its volume of
air, it exploded freely. The mixture which seemed
to possess the greatest explosive power was that of
seven or eight parts of air to one of gas.</p>

<p>On adding azote and carbonic acid in different
proportions to explosive mixtures of fire-damp, it
was observed that, even in very small quantities,
these gases diminished the velocity of the inflammation,
or altogether destroyed it. In this stage of
the enquiry, the important fact was discovered, that
explosive mixtures could not be fired in metallic
tubes of certain lengths and diameters.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> In exploding,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
for instance, a mixture of one part of gas
from the distillation of coal, and eight parts of air,
in a tube of a quarter of an inch in diameter and A
foot long, more than a second was required before
the flame reached from one end of the tube to the
other; and not any mixture could be made to explode
in a glass tube of one-seventh of an inch in
diameter. In pursuing these experiments, he found
that, by diminishing its diameter, he might in the
same ratio shorten the tube without danger; and
that the same principle of security was obtained by
diminishing the length and increasing the number
of the tubes, so that a great number of small apertures
would not pass explosion when their depth
was equal to their diameter. This fact led him to
trials upon sieves made of wire-gauze, or metallic
plates perforated with numerous small holes, and he
found that it was impossible to pass explosions
through them.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>In reasoning upon these several phenomena, it
occurred to him, that as a high temperature was required
for the inflammation of the fire-damp, and as
it produced in burning, comparatively, <em>a small degree</em>
of heat, the effect of carbonic acid and azote,
as well as that of the surfaces of small tubes, in preventing
its explosion, depended upon their cooling
powers; that is to say, upon their lowering the temperature
of the exploding mixture to such a degree,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
that it was no longer sufficient for its continuous inflammation.
In support of this theory, he ascertained
that metallic tubes resisted the passage of the
flame more powerfully than glass tubes of similar
lengths and diameters, metal being the better conductor
of heat; and that carbonic acid was more effective
than azote in depriving the fire-damp of its
explosive power, in consequence, as he considered,
of its greater capacity for heat, and likewise of a
higher conducting power connected with its greater
density.</p>

<p>In this short statement, the reader is presented
with the whole theory and operation of the Safety-lamp,
which is nothing more than an apparatus by
which the inflammable air, upon exploding in its interior,
cannot pass out without being so far cooled,
as to deprive it of the power of communicating inflammation
to the surrounding atmosphere. The
principle having been once discovered, it was easy
to adopt and multiply practical applications of it.</p>

<p>From the result of these researches, it became at
once evident, that to light mines infested with fire-damp,
with perfect security, it was only necessary to
use an air-tight lantern, supplied with air from tubes
of small diameter, through which explosions cannot
pass, and with a chimney, on a similar principle, at
the upper part, to carry off the foul air. A common
lantern, to be adapted to the purpose, merely
required to be made air-tight in the door and sides,
and to be furnished with the chimney, and the system
of safety apertures below and above the flame
of the lamp. Such, in fact, was Davy's first Safety-lamp;
and having afterwards varied the arrangement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
of the tubes in different ways, he at length
exchanged them for canals, which consisted of close
concentric hollow metallic cylinders of different diameter,
so placed together as to form circular canals
of the diameter of from one-twenty-fifth to one
fortieth of an inch; and of an inch and seven-tenths
in length; by which air is admitted in much larger
quantities than by the small tubes, and they are
moreover much superior to the latter in practical application.
He also found, that longitudinal air-canals
of metal might be employed with the same security
as circular canals; and that a few pieces of tin
plate, soldered together with wires to regulate the
diameter of the canal, answered the purpose of the
feeder or safe chimney, as well as drawn cylinders
of brass.</p>

<p>The subjoined explanatory sketches will assist in
rendering the scheme intelligible, and obviate the
possibility of any misconception of the subject.</p>

During the short visit of Sir Humphry Davy at
Bishop Wearmouth, he saw the lamp which Dr.
Clanny was then engaged in perfecting. It has
been already observed, that it was secured against
the effects of fire-damp by being supplied with atmospheric
air previously conveyed through water.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
The machinery of this lamp was far too cumbrous
to be of general use; but its inventor was justly
commended by Davy for his ingenuity and perseverance.
It unfortunately happened that, in consequence
of some erroneous representations made
to Dr. Clanny, he received the impression that Sir
Humphry had not been disposed to treat his invention
with sufficient respect, nor had given him
the credit to which he was so justly entitled. This
suspicion, which had been long industriously kept
alive, was however ultimately removed.</p>

<p>The following letter refers to this unfortunate
circumstance. I have adverted to it in these memoirs,
for the purpose of showing what an unfair
spirit of rivalry, and what a succession of petty jealousies
were excited by those generous and disinterested
labours of Davy, which ought to have
called forth nothing but the most lively expressions
of gratitude for his services, and admiration of his
genius.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO THE REVEREND DR. GRAY.</p>

<p class="date">23, Grosvenor Street, December 13.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>A Friend of mine has sent me a newspaper&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Tyne Mercury, containing a very foolish libel
upon me. It states, amongst other things, that I
did not mention Dr. Clanny, or his lamp, in my late
paper read before the Royal Society; whereas I
mentioned his lamp as a very ingenious contrivance,
and named him amongst the gentlemen who obligingly
furnished me with information upon the
subject.</p>

<p>It will be needless for me to point out to you
that my lamp has no one principle in common with
that of Dr. Clanny. He forces in his air through
water by bellows. In mine, the air passes through
safety canals without any mechanical assistance.
Mine is a common lantern made close, and furnished
with safety canals.</p>

<p>I hope I shall not hear that Dr. Clanny has in
any way authorized or promoted so improper a statement
as that in the Tyne Mercury; indeed, I do
not think it possible.</p>

<p>I have at last obtained a complete model of my
lamp, after many disappointments from the instrument-maker.
I hope in a few days to send you a
<em>Safe lantern</em>, as portable as a common-made one, and

<p class="center">TO THE SAME.</p>

<p class="date">London, January 1, 1816.</p>

<p class="opening"><span class="smcap">MY DEAR SIR</span>,</p>

<p>I fear you will have accused me of procrastination
in delaying to send you my papers and my
lamps.</p>

<p>The papers read to the Royal Society have been
printed; but during the period that has elapsed
since I last wrote to you, I have made a discovery
much more important than those which I have already
had the honour of communicating to you.</p>

<p>I have made very simple and economical lanterns,
and candle guards, which are not only <em>absolutely
safe</em>, but which give light by means of the fire-damp,
and which, while they disarm this destructive
agent, make it useful to the miner.</p>

<p>This discovery is a consequence of that which I
communicated to you in my last letter on the wire
sieves. I hope to be able to send you on Wednesday
the printed account of my results, together
with models of lamps which will burn and consume
all explosive mixtures of the fire-damp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
I have at last finished my enquiries with perfect
satisfaction to myself, and I feel highly obliged to
you for having called my attention to a subject
where my labours will, I hope, be of some use.</p>

<p>I am, my dear Sir, very sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">H. Davy</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>It is impossible to approach the consideration of
this last, the most signal and splendid of his triumphs,
without feelings of the highest satisfaction.
He had already, as we have seen, disarmed the fire-damp
of its terrors, it only remained for him to enlist
it into his service. The simple means by which
this was effected are as interesting as their results
are important.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Davy had previously arrived at the fact, that
wire-gauze might be substituted as air-feeders to
the lamp, in the place of his tubes or safety canals;
but not until after the lapse of several weeks, did
the happy idea of constructing the lamp entirely of
wire-gauze occur to him:&mdash;the history of this elaborate
enquiry affords a striking proof of the inability
of the human mind to apprehend simplicities,
without a process of complication which works
as the grappling machinery of truth.</p>

<p>His original lamp with tubes or canals, as already
described, was perfectly safe in the most explosive
atmosphere, but its light was necessarily extinguished
by it; whereas in the wire-gauze cage, the fire-damp
itself continues to burn, and thus to afford to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
the miner a useful light, while he is equally secured
from the fatal effects of explosion.</p>

<div class="image-left">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_104.jpg" alt="" />
</div>

<p>All then required for his guidance and
protection in the darkness of the mine, are
candles or lamps surrounded by small wire
cages, which will at once supply air to the
flame, and light to the miner; they may
be obtained for a few pence, and be variously
modified as circumstances may render
necessary.</p>

<p>The reader is here presented with a
sketch of the gauze instrument, in its first and simplest
form. The original lamp is preserved in the
laboratory of the Royal Institution.</p>

<p>Nothing now remained but to ascertain the degree
of fineness which the wire-gauze ought to possess,
in order to form a secure barrier against the
passage of flame. For this purpose, Davy placed
his lighted lamps in a glass receiver, through which
there was a current of atmospherical air, and by
means of a gasometer filled with coal gas, he made
the current of air which passed into the lamp more
or less explosive, and caused it to change rapidly or
slowly at pleasure, so as to produce all possible varieties
of inflammable and explosive mixtures; and
he found that iron wire-gauze composed of wires
from one-fortieth to one-sixtieth of an inch in diameter,
and containing twenty-eight wires, or seven
hundred and eighty-four apertures to the inch, was
safe under all circumstances in atmospheres of this
kind; and he consequently employed that material
in guarding lamps for the coal mines, where, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
January 1816, they were immediately adopted, and
have long been in general use.</p>

<p>Observations upon them in their working state,
and upon the circumstances to which they are exposed,
have led to a few improvements or alterations,
merely connected with the modes of increasing light
or diminishing heat, which were obvious from the
original construction.</p>

<div class="image-left">

<p>The annexed woodcut represents the
lamp which is in present use. A is a cylinder
of wire-gauze, with a double top,
securely and carefully fastened, by doubling
over, to the brass rim B, which screws
on to the lamp C. The whole is protected
by strong iron supports D, to which a ring
is affixed for the convenience of carrying it.</p>

<p>In a paper read before the Royal Society,
on the 23rd of January 1817, entitled,
"Some new Experiments and Observations
on the Combustion of Gaseous
Mixtures, with an Account of a method of preserving
a continued Light in mixtures of inflammable
Gases and Air without Flame," Sir H. Davy announces
the application of a principle which he had
discovered in the progress of his researches for increasing
the utility of the Safety-lamp, and which, a
century ago, would have unquestionably exposed its
author to the charge of witchcraft.</p>

<p>Having ascertained that the temperature of flame
is infinitely higher than that necessary for the ignition
of solid bodies, it appeared to him probable
that, in certain combinations of gaseous bodies,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
although the increase of temperature might not be
sufficient to render the gaseous matters themselves
luminous, they might nevertheless be adequate to
ignite solid matters exposed to them. During his
experiments on this subject, he was led to the discovery
of the curious phenomenon of slow combustion
without flame. He observes, that there cannot
be a better mode of illustrating the fact, than by an
experiment on the vapour of ether or of alcohol.
Let a few coils of wire of platinum of the one-sixtieth
or one-seventieth of an inch be heated by a
hot poker or candle, and let it be brought into the
glass; it will presently become glowing, almost
white hot, and will continue so, as long as a sufficient
quantity of vapour and of air remain in the
glass.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>This experiment on the slow combustion of ether
is accompanied with the formation of a peculiar
acrid and volatile substance possessed of acid properties,
which has been particularly examined by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
Mr. Daniell, who, having at first regarded it as a
new acid, proposed for it the name of <em>Lampic</em> acid,
in allusion to the researches which led to its discovery;
he has, however, since ascertained that its
acidity is owing to the acetic acid, which is combined
with some compound of carbon and hydrogen,
different both from ether and alcohol.</p>

<p>The phenomena of slow combustion, as exhibited
in certain states of the mine, by the Safety-lamp,
are highly curious and interesting.</p>

<p>By suspending some coils of fine wire of platinum<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
above the wick of his lamp, the miner will
be supplied with light in mixtures of fire-damp no
longer explosive; for should his flame be extinguished
by the quantity of fire-damp, the little coil
of platinum will begin to glow with a light sufficiently
bright to guide him in what would otherwise
be impenetrable darkness, and to lead him into
a purer atmosphere, when the heat thus increased
will very frequently be sufficient to rekindle his
lamp!</p>

<p>In this case it will be readily perceived, that the
combustion of the fire-damp is continued so slowly,
and at so low a temperature, as not to be adequate
to that ignition of gaseous matter which constitutes
flame, although it excites a temperature sufficient to
render platinum wire luminous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Sir Humphry Davy observes, that there never
can be any danger with respect to respiration, whenever
the wire continues ignited; for even this phenomenon
ceases when the foul air forms about two-fifths
of the volume of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The experiment, as originally performed by the
illustrious chemist, is so interesting and instructive,
that I shall here relate it in his own words.</p>

<p>"I introduced into a wire-gauze Safe lamp a
small cage made of fine wire of platinum of one-seventieth
of an inch in thickness, and fixed it by
means of a thick wire of the same metal about two
inches above the wick which was lighted. I placed
the whole apparatus in a large receiver, in which, by
means of a gas-holder, the air could be contaminated
to any extent with coal gas. As soon as
there was a slight admixture of coal gas, the platinum
became ignited; the ignition continued to
increase till the flame of the wick was extinguished,
and till the whole cylinder became filled with flame;
it then diminished. When the quantity of coal gas
was increased, so as to extinguish the flame, at the
moment of the extinction the cage of platinum became
white hot, and presented a most brilliant light.
By increasing the quantity of the coal gas still farther,
the ignition of the platinum became less vivid:
when its light was barely sensible, small quantities
of air were admitted, its heat speedily increased;
and by regulating the admission of coal gas and air,
it again became white hot, and soon after lighted
the flame in the cylinder, which as usual, by the
addition of more atmospherical air, rekindled the
flame of the wick."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
I have thus related, somewhat in detail, the history
of a discovery, which, whether considered in
relation to its scientific importance, or to its great
practical value, must be regarded as one of the most
splendid triumphs of human genius. It was the
fruit of elaborate experiment and close induction;
chance, or accident, which comes in for so large a
share of the credit of human invention, has no
claims to prefer upon this occasion; step by step,
may he be followed throughout the whole progress
of his research, and so obviously does the discovery
of each new fact spring from those that preceded it,
that we never for a moment lose sight of our philosopher,
but keep pace with him during the whole
of his curious enquiry.</p>

<p>He commenced, as we have seen, with ascertaining
the degree of combustibility of the fire-damp,
and the limits in which the proportions of
atmospheric air and carburetted hydrogen can be
combined, so as to afford an explosive mixture. He
was then led to examine the effects of the admixture
of azote and carbonic acid gas; and the result
of those experiments furnished him with the basis
of his first plan of security. His next step was
to enquire whether explosions of gas would pass
through tubes; and on finding that this did not
happen, if the tubes were of certain lengths and
diameters, he proceeded to examine the limits of
such conditions, and by shortening the tubes, diminishing
their diameters, and multiplying their
number, he at length arrived at the conclusion, that
a simple tissue of wire-gauze afforded all the means
of perfect security; and he constructed a lamp,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
which has been truly declared to be as marvellous
in its operation, as the storied lamp of Aladdin,
realizing its fabled powers of conducting in safety,
through "fiends of combustion," to the hidden treasures
of the earth. We behold a power which, in
its effects, seemed to emulate the violence of the
volcano and the earthquake, at once restrained by
an almost invisible and impalpable barrier of network&mdash;we
behold, as it were, the dæmon of fire
taken captive by Science, and ministering to the
convenience of the miner, while harmlessly fluttering
in an iron cage.</p>

<p>And yet, wonderful as the phenomenon may appear,
his experiments and reasonings have demonstrated,
that the interruption of flame by solid tissues
permeable to light and air, depends upon no
recondite or mysterious cause, but simply upon
their cooling powers, which must always be proportional
to the smallness of the mesh, and the mass
of the metal.</p>

<p>When it is remembered that the security thus
conferred upon the labouring community, is not
merely the privilege of the age in which the discovery
was effected, but must be extended to future
times, and continue to preserve human life as long
as coal is dug from our mines, can there be found
in the whole compass of art or science, an invention
more useful and glorious?</p>

<p>The wire-gauze lamp has now been several years
extensively used in the mines, and the most satisfactory
and unequivocal testimonies have been published
of the complete security which it affords.
They have amongst the miners obtained the name of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
<em>Davys</em>; and such is the confidence of the work men
in their efficacy, that by their aid they enter the
most explosive atmospheres, and explore the most
remote caverns, without the least dread of their old
enemy the <em>fire-damp</em>.</p>

<p>Into the mines of foreign countries the Safety-lamp
has been introduced with similar success; and
the illustrious discoverer has been repeatedly gratified
by accounts of the enthusiasm with which
his invention has been adopted in various parts of
Europe.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
Nor is the utility of this invention limited to the
operations of mining. In gas manufactories, spirit
warehouses,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> or druggists' laboratories, and in various
other situations, where the existence of an explosive
atmosphere<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> may expose persons to danger,
the Safety-lamp may be advantageously used; and
as science proceeds in multiplying the resources of
art, this instrument will no doubt be found capable
of many new applications.</p>

<p>By the permission of the President and Council
of the Royal Society, several accounts of these researches,
and of the invention and use of the Safety-lamp
were printed, and circulated through the coal
districts.</p>

<p>It might have been fairly expected that, in a district
which had been so continually and so awfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
visited by explosions, against which no human foresight
had as yet been able to provide a remedy, the
disinterested services of the greatest chemist of the
age would at least have been received without a dissentient
voice, and that his invention of security
would have escaped the common fate of all great
discoveries, and been accepted with every homage
of respect and gratitude; but the inventor of the
Safety-lamp was doomed to encounter a bitter hostility
from persons whom a spirit of rivalry, or a feeling
of hopeless emulation, had cemented into a faction.</p>

<p>From the period of the first announcement of the
Safety-lamp, a prejudice against its use was industriously
circulated amongst the miners; and some
persons even maintained the monstrous proposition,
that any protection against the explosions of fire-damp
would injure more than it could serve the
collier, by inducing him to resume abandoned works,
and thus continually to inhale a noxious atmosphere.</p>

<p>The utility of the lamp having been established,
in spite of every opposition, the claims of Sir H.
Davy to its invention were next publicly challenged.</p>

<p>It will hereafter be scarcely believed that an invention
so eminently philosophic, and which could
never have been derived but from the sterling treasury
of science, should have been claimed in behalf
of an engine-wright of Killingworth, of the name of
Stephenson&mdash;a person not even professing a knowledge
of the elements of chemistry. As the controversy
to which this claim gave birth has long since
subsided, I would willingly have treated it as a
passing cloud, had not its shadow remained. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
circumstances, however, of the transaction stand
recorded in the Magazines of the day, and the biographer
of Davy would compromise his rights, by
omitting to notice the attempts that have been made
to invalidate them.</p>

<p>The claims which were made for the priority of
Mr. Stephenson's invention of the Safety-lamp were
urged in several communications in the Newcastle
Courant. It has been said in reply, that if dates
were taken as evidence, not merely of priority, but
of originality of invention, it must follow that Mr.
Stephenson's lamp was derived from that of Sir H.
Davy. With regard to the first of Stephenson's
lamps, the only one upon which the shadow even of
a claim can be founded, it is unnecessary for the
friends of truth to adopt such a line of defence; indeed,
after a deliberate examination of all that has
been published on the subject, I am very willing to
believe that Mr. Stephenson did construct the lamp
which dates its origin from the 21st of October
1815, without any previous knowledge of the conclusions
at which Davy had arrived; for it was first
announced to the Coal-trade by Mr. R. Lambert on
the 3rd of November, to the very meeting at which
Sir H. Davy's private letter was inadvertently read.&mdash;But
what were the principles, and what the construction
of this lamp?</p>

<p>It would appear that Mr. Stephenson had entertained
some vague notion of the practicability of
consuming the fire-damp as fast as it entered the
lamp, and that if admitted only in small quantities, it
would not explode the surrounding atmosphere: for
effecting this object, he constructed a lamp with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
orifice, over which was placed a slide, by the movement
of which the opening could be enlarged, or
diminished, and the volume of fire-damp to be admitted
into the lamp regulated according to circumstances.
Now such a lamp could be nothing else
than an exploding lamp; for to make it burn in common
air, the orifice must have been so wide that, on
going into an explosive atmosphere, the combustion
in the interior could not have failed to pass it, and
to have exploded the mine. Here then is a <em>safety</em>-lamp,
which as long as it is safe, will not burn, and
the moment it begins to burn, it becomes unsafe!</p>

<p>The testimonies in favour of the security afforded
by this lamp were evidently procured from persons
who were not only ignorant of the principles of its
construction, but of the methods to be pursued for
ascertaining its safety. I am surely justified in such
a statement, when, instead of an <em>explosive mixture</em>, I
find them throwing in <em>pure fire-damp</em>, which will
always extinguish flame, whether burning in a safe
or unsafe lamp.</p>

<p>The importance and utility of Davy's lamp having
been completely established by the severest ordeals,
the general gratitude of the country began more
publicly to display itself, and a very strong feeling
prevailed, that some tribute of respect should be
paid to its inventor; in accordance with which, a
deputation of the Coal-owners of the rivers Tyne
and Wear, and of the ports of Hartley and Blyth,
requested the honour of an interview with Sir H.
Davy; upon which occasion they presented him
with the following letter, containing an expression
of the thanks of the Coal-owners.</p>

<p class="opening"><span class="smcap">SIR</span>,</p>

<p>As chairman of the general meeting of proprietors
of coal-mines upon the rivers Tyne and Wear,
held in the Assembly-rooms at Newcastle, on the
18th instant, I was requested to express to you
their united thanks and approbation for the great
and important discovery of your Safety-lamp for exploring
mines charged with inflammable gas, which
they consider admirably calculated to obviate those
dreadful calamities, and the lamentable sacrifice of
human life, which of late years have so frequently
occurred in the mines of this country.</p>

<p>They are most powerfully impressed with admiration
and gratitude towards the splendid talents and
brilliant acquirements that have achieved so momentous
and important a discovery, unparalleled in
the history of mining, and not surpassed by any discovery
of the present age; and they hope that,
whilst the tribute of applause and glory is showered
down upon those who invent the weapons of destruction,
this great and unrivalled discovery for
preserving the lives of our fellow-creatures, will be
rewarded by some mark of national distinction and
honour. I am, Sir,</p>

<p class="signature">Your most obedient humble Servant,<br />
<span class="smcap j4">George Waldie</span>, Chairman.</p>
</div>

<p>A plan, however, was under consideration for recording
the admiration and gratitude of the Coal-owners,
by a more permanent and solid memorial.
The nature of this proposition will be best disclosed
by inserting the following letter from Mr. Buddle.</p>

<p>As I know that you feel much interest in all
matters relating to Sir H. Davy's Safety-lamp, I
trust you will excuse the liberty I take in informing
you, that the Committee of the Tyne, approving
highly of the suggestion, that some mark of acknowledgment
and respect should be presented to
Sir Humphry by the Coal-trade of this country, for
the happy invention of his lamp, have convened a
general meeting of Coal-owners, to be holden at my
office in Newcastle, on Saturday next the 31st instant,
at twelve o'clock, to take the subject into
consideration.</p>

<p>I should have sooner informed you of this proposed
meeting, had I not been detained in Cumberland
until yesterday; but I shall have the pleasure
of transmitting to you a copy of its resolutions.</p>

<p>I am sure that you will be gratified to learn that
the lamps continue to go on as well as possible.
We now have twelve dozen of them in daily use at
this place. I have the pleasure to remain, with the
greatest respect, Sir,</p>

<p>I now have the pleasure of sending you a copy of
the Resolutions of the general meeting of Coal-owners
on the 31st instant, and shall take the liberty

<p>Sir Humphry did me the honour yesterday to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
accompany me through the workings of a coal-pit at
Wall's-End, when I had an opportunity of witnessing
several interesting experiments on his Safety-lamp;
and I have the satisfaction to add, that I

of perfection.</p>

<p class="signature">I am, respectfully, Sir,<br />

<span class="smcap j6">John Buddle</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>The satisfactory result of this visit Sir Humphry
communicated to Mr. Lambton, now Lord Durham;
and I shall take this opportunity to state, that
for this as well as for several other letters I shall
hereafter have occasion to introduce, I am indebted
to that noble Lord, through the kind application of
my friend Sir Cuthbert Sharp.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO J. G. LAMBTON, ESQ. M.P.</p>

<p class="date">Newcastle, September 9, 1816.</p>

<p class="opening"><span class="smcap">MY DEAR SIR</span>,</p>

<p>Since I last had the pleasure of seeing you, I
have examined the workings in the Wall's-End collieries
by the lamps, and have tried them in various
explosive mixtures.</p>

<p>On Sunday, I went with Mr. Buddle to your
<em>blower</em>, with the single lamps furnished with small
tin reflectors. This simple modification rendered
them perfectly safe, even in the furious <em>blow-pipe</em>,
and at the same time increased their light. Nothing
could be more satisfactory than all the trials.</p>

<p>I have left a paper in the hands of the Rev. J.
Hodgson, which will be printed in a day or two;
and I have desired him to send you ten copies, or as
many more as you may like to have.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
I trust I have now left nothing undone as to the
perfect security of the lamps, under every possible
circumstance.</p>

<p>I feel highly gratified that it was at your mines I
effected the only object that remained to be accomplished&mdash;that
of guarding against <em>blowers</em> meeting
fresh currents of air.</p>

<p>I thank you very sincerely for the interest you
have taken in the lamps, connected with my efforts
to render them applicable in all cases. I remain, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">H. Davy</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>On the 19th of October 1816, a letter appeared in
the Durham County Advertiser, dated "Gosforth,
August 22nd, 1816," in the name of Mr. W. Brandling,
in which, alluding to the Resolutions of the
Coal-owners of the 31st of August, he expresses a
wish that a strict examination should take place
previous to the adoption of a measure which might
convey a decided opinion to the public, as to the
person to whom the invaluable discovery of the
Safety-lamp is actually due. "The conviction,"
says he, "upon my mind is, that Mr. George Stephenson,
of Killingworth Colliery, is the person
who first discovered and applied the principle upon
which safe lamps may be constructed; for, whether
the hydrogen gas is admitted through capillary
tubes, or through the apertures of wire-gauze, which
may be considered as merely the orifices of capillary
tubes, does not, as I conceive, in the least affect the
principle.</p>

<p>"In the communications I have seen from Sir H.
Davy, no dates are mentioned; and it is by a reference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
to them only that the question can be fairly
decided. For the information of the Meeting,
therefore, I shall take the liberty of enclosing some
which I received from Mr. Stephenson, to the correctness
of which, as far as I am concerned, I can
bear testimony; at the same time I beg leave to
add, that the principle of admitting hydrogen gas
in such small detached portions that it would be
consumed by combustion,<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> was, I understand, stated
by him to several gentlemen, as the idea he had embraced
two months before his lamp was originally
constructed."</p>

<p>Mr. Brandling then proceeds to state, that the
Killingworth lamp, with a tube to admit the air,
and a slide at the bottom of such tube to regulate
the quantity to be admitted, was first tried in the
Killingworth pits on Saturday October the 21st,
1815; but not being found to burn well, another
was ordered the same day with three capillary tubes
to admit the air; and on being tried in the mine on
the 4th of November following, was found to burn
better and to be perfectly <em>safe</em>.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> On the 17th of
November, it was <em>tried</em><a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> at Killingworth office with
inflammable air before Richard Lambert, Esq.; and
on the 24th of the same month, before C. J. Brandling,
Esq. and Mr. Murray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
"On the 30th of November," he says, "a lamp
was tried in the mine, in which the air was admitted
by means of a double row of small perforations, and
found to be perfectly safe, and to burn extremely
well."<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>At an adjourned Meeting of the Coal-owners,
held on the 11th of October 1816, J. G. Lambton,
Esq. M.P. in the chair; Mr. William Brandling
moved&mdash;"That the meeting do adjourn, until, by
a comparison of dates, it shall be ascertained whether
the merit of the Safety-lamp belongs to Sir
Humphry Davy or to Mr. George Stephenson."</p>

<p>On the question being put thereon, <span class="smcap">THE SAME
PASSED IN THE NEGATIVE</span>.</p>

<p>A great number of the Coal-owners, instead of
pursuing the idea which had at first been suggested,
of a general contribution on the vend, immediately
commenced a subscription of individual proprietors
of coal-mines; a measure which, it was thought,
would express more distinctly and unequivocally
the opinion of the trade as to the merit of the invention.
The plan is developed in the following
letter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO THE REVEREND DR. GRAY.</p>

<p class="date">Wall's-End Colliery, October 27, 1816.</p>

<p class="opening"><span class="smcap">SIR</span>,</p>

<p>It is the anxious wish of almost every individual
in the trade to compliment Sir Humphry
Davy, in that way which may be most grateful to
his feelings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
It has been suggested that the object will be best
attained by substituting an individual (colliery) subscription,
instead of the proposed contribution on
the vend; and it will at the same time show more
distinctly the real opinion of the trade as to the
merit of the invention.</p>

<p>This idea was not suggested till yesterday afternoon,
and of course there has been but little time to
communicate it to the several Coal-owners; but <em>all</em>
who have heard of the plan approve of it.</p>

<p>To facilitate the business, the committee have
formed the annexed scale of contribution.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>I trust, Sir, you will excuse the trouble which I
have given you on this subject; but I am aware
that you must feel interested in it; and I hope,
Sir, you will allow me to add, that I am fully sensible
of the obligation which the Coal trade is under
to yourself, for having drawn Sir H. Davy's attention
to that particular line of investigation, which
has led to the important discovery of the Safety-lamp.
I am, Sir, with the greatest respect, your
most obedient humble servant,</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">John Buddle</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>Some slight alterations were afterwards made
in this scheme, in consequence of a wish having
been expressed that the Bishop of Durham and
the Duke of Northumberland should take the lead
in a subscription. The following letter conveys
some farther information upon this subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO THE REVEREND DR. GRAY.</p>

<p class="date">Newcastle, January 11, 1817.</p>

<p class="opening"><span class="smcap">SIR</span>,</p>

<p>I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of the 9th instant, communicating the intention of
the Reverend the Dean and Chapter of Durham,
to subscribe fifty guineas towards the plate to be
presented to Sir H. Davy, which, together with
two hundred guineas from the Coal-owners of the
Wear, makes the subscription amount to nearly
£1500, and I shall expect some farther subscriptions.</p>

<p>I am sure it will afford you satisfaction to learn
that the lamps still continue to give the most gratifying
proofs of the advantages resulting from their
invention, and that not a single inch of human
skin has been lost by fire, wherever they have
been used.</p>

<p>Sir Humphry has just made another important
improvement in the lamp, by constructing the cylinder
of <em>twisted</em> wire-gauze. Lamps thus constructed,
possess the singular property of not
becoming red-hot, under any circumstances of exposure
to explosive mixtures, whether urged by a
blast, or in a state of rest. I am with great respect,
Sir, your most obedient humble servant,</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">John Buddle</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>It may be collected from the following letter,
that the Committee, in announcing to Sir H. Davy
the intended present of plate, delicately sounded

agreeable to him.</p>

<p class="center">TO N. CLAYTON, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">Grosvenor Street, March 23, 1817.</p>

<p class="opening"><span class="smcap">SIR</span>,</p>

<p>On my return to town, after an absence of some
days, I found the letter of March the 13th, with
which you honoured me, at the Royal Institution.
I shall not lose a moment in replying to it, and in
expressing my grateful feelings for the very flattering
communication it contains.</p>

<p>The gentlemen interested in the coal-mines of the
two rivers Tyne and Wear, cannot offer me any testimony
of their kindness, which I shall not receive
with infinite pleasure.</p>

<p>I hardly know how to explain myself on the particular
subject of your letter; but as the Committee
express themselves satisfied as to the utility of the
Safety-lamp, I can only desire that their present, as
it is highly honourable to me, should be likewise
useful to my friends, and a small social circle, which
it would be as a dinner-service for ten or twelve
persons.</p>

<p>I wish that even the plate from which I eat should
awaken my remembrance of their liberality, and put
me in mind of an event which marks one of the happiest
periods of my life.</p>

<p>I cannot find any language sufficiently strong to
express my thanks to the gentlemen for the manner
in which they have distinguished my exertions in
their cause, and in the cause of humanity. I have
the honour to remain, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">H. Davy</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>To revert once again to the faction&mdash;for such I
must denominate it&mdash;which, in opposition to the
most unequivocal evidence, continued to support
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
the unjust claims of Mr. Stephenson; it would appear
from various letters in my possession, that the
feelings of Davy were greatly exasperated by this
ungenerous conduct.</p>

<p>I shall introduce one of these letters, playful in
the midst of its wrath, addressed to Mr. Lambton,
the friend<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> of his youth, and the manly and kind
supporter of his scientific character, in the hour of
persecution.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO J. G. LAMBTON, ESQ. M.P.</p>

<p class="date">Queen Square, Bath, Oct. 29, 1816.</p>

<p class="opening"><span class="smcap">MY DEAR SIR</span>,</p>

<p>The severe indisposition of my wife has altered
my plans. Your letter slowly followed me here.</p>

<p>Mr. &mdash;&mdash; is one of the persons who, after I
had advanced a principle of security for a lamp,
came upon the ground to endeavour to jockey me.
I was not looking to a prize, I merely came forward
to show an animal, the breed of which might be
useful, when Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, Dr. &mdash;&mdash;, &amp;c. brought their
sorry jades, which had never before been seen or
heard of, to kick at my blood mare.</p>

<p>I never heard a word of George Stephenson and
his lamps till six weeks after my principle of security
had been published; and the general impression of
the scientific men in London, which is confirmed by
what I heard at Newcastle, is, that Stephenson had
some loose idea floating in his mind, which he had
unsuccessfully attempted to put in practice till after
my labours were made known;&mdash;then, he made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
something like a safe lamp, except that it is not <em>safe</em>,
for the apertures below are four times, and those
above, twenty times too large; but, even if Stephenson's
plans had not been posterior to my principles,
still there is no analogy between his glass exploding
machine, and my metallic tissue, permeable to light
and air, and impermeable to flame.</p>

<p>I am very glad that you attended the meeting;
your conduct at no very distant period will be contrasted
with that of some great coal-proprietors, who
find reasons for their indifference, as to a benefit
conferred upon them, in insinuations respecting the
claims of Dr. Clanny, Mr. Stephenson, and others.</p>

<p>Where men resolve to be ungrateful, it is natural
that they should be illiberal; and illiberality often
hardens into malignity.</p>

<p>I shall receive any present of plate under your
auspices, and those of the Committee over which
you preside, with peculiar satisfaction. It will prove
to me that my labours have not been disregarded by
men of whose good opinion I am proud.</p>

<p>I hope you will not blame me for not taking any
notice of the attacks of my enemies in the North.
I have no desire to go out of my way to crush gnats
that buzz at a distance, and do not bite me, or to
quarrel with persons who shoot arrows at the moon,
and believe, because they have for an instant intercepted
a portion of her light, that they have hit their
mark. I am sensible to the circumstances under
which you attended the meeting.</p>

<p>I offer you my sincere congratulations, and ardent
wishes that you may enjoy all possible happiness.</p>

<p>Believe me, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="signature">H. Davy.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
On the 13th of September 1817, Sir Humphry
Davy being expected to pass through Newcastle on
his return from Scotland, preparations were made,
and notice given of a dinner which it was proposed
should take place on the 25th instant, for the purpose
of presenting to the illustrious philosopher the
service of plate which had been prepared for his
acceptance.</p>

<p>Upon this gratifying occasion, a very large party
assembled at the Queen's Head, consisting of a numerous
and respectable body of Coal-owners, and
such other gentlemen as had interested themselves
during the progress of the investigation, or taken an
active part in promoting the introduction of the
lamp into the mines.</p>

<p>After the dinner had concluded, and certain toasts
of form had been drunk, Mr. Lambton, who filled
the chair on the occasion, rose, and on presenting
the service of plate to the illustrious guest, addressed
him, in a tone of great animation and feeling,
in nearly the following terms:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir Humphry</span>,&mdash;It now becomes my duty to
fulfill the object of the meeting, in presenting to
you this service of plate, from the Coal-owners of
the Tyne and Wear, as a testimony of their gratitude
for the services you have rendered to them
and to humanity.</p>

<p>"Your brilliant genius, which has been so long
employed in an unparalleled manner, in extending
the boundaries of chemical knowledge, never accomplished
a higher object, nor obtained a nobler
triumph.</p>

<p>"You had to contend with an element of destruction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
which seemed uncontrollable by human power;
which not only rendered the property of the coal-owner
insecure, but kept him in perpetual alarm for
the safety of the intrepid miner in his service, and
often exhibited to him the most appalling scenes of
death, and heart-sickening misery.</p>

<p>"You have increased the value of an important
branch of productive industry; and, what is of infinitely
greater importance, you have contributed to
the lives and persons of multitudes of your fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>"It is now nearly two years that your Safety-lamp
has been used by hundreds of miners in the
most dangerous recesses of the earth, and under the
most trying circumstances. Not a single failure has
occurred&mdash;its absolute security is demonstrated. I
have, indeed, deeply to lament more than one catastrophe,
produced by fool-hardiness and ignorance,
in neglecting to use the safeguard you have supplied;
but these dreadful accidents even, if possible,
exalt its importance.</p>

<p>"If your fame had needed any thing to make it
immortal, this discovery alone would have carried it
down to future ages, and connected it with benefits
and blessings.</p>

<p>"Receive, Sir Humphry, this permanent memorial
of our profound respect and high admiration&mdash;a
testimony, we trust, equally honourable to you and
to us. We hope you will have as much pleasure in
receiving, as we feel in offering it. Long may you
live to use it&mdash;long may you live to pursue your
splendid career of scientific discovery, and to give
new claims to the gratitude and praise of the world!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Sir Humphry having received the plate, replied
as follows:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;I feel it impossible to reply, in
an appropriate manner, to the very eloquent and
flattering address of your distinguished Chairman.
Eloquence, or even accuracy of language, is incompatible
with strong feeling; and on an occasion like
the present, you will give me credit for no small
degree of emotion.</p>

<p>"I have been informed that my labours have
been useful to an important branch of human industry
connected with our arts, our manufactures,
commerce, and national wealth. To learn this from
such practical authority is the highest gratification
to a person whose ardent desire has always been to
apply science to purposes of utility.</p>

<p>"It has been also stated, that the invention which
you are this day so highly honouring, has been subservient
to the preservation of the lives and persons
of a most useful and laborious class of men: this,
coming from your own knowledge, founded upon
such ample experience, affords me a pleasure still
more exalted&mdash;for the highest ambition of my life
has been to deserve the name of a friend to humanity.</p>

<p>"To crown all, you have, as it were, embodied
these sentiments in a permanent and magnificent
memorial of your good opinion. I can make only
imperfect and inadequate efforts to thank you.</p>

<p>"Under all circumstances of my future life,
the recollection of this day will warm my heart;
and this noble expression of your kindness will
awaken my gratitude to the latest moment of my
existence."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Sir Humphry having sat down, and the cheering
of the company subsided, the Chairman proposed
the health of the illustrious Chemist, in three times
three.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen," said Sir Humphry, "I am overpowered
by these reiterated proofs of your approbation.
You have overrated my merits. My success
in your cause must be attributed to my having
followed the path of experiment and induction discovered
by philosophers who have preceded me:
willingly would I divide your plaudits with other
men of science, and claim much for the general
glory of scientific discovery in a long course of
ages.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I might dwell at some length upon
the great increase of wealth and power to the country,
within the last half century, by scientific invention,
which never could have existed without coal-mines:&mdash;I
shall refer only to the improvement in
the potteries, to the steam-engine, and to the discovery
of the gas lights.</p>

<p>"What an immense impulse has the steam-engine
given to the arts and manufactures! How much
has it diminished labour, and increased the real
strength of the country, far beyond a mere increase
of population! By giving facilities to a number of
other inventions, it has produced even a moral effect
in rendering capital necessary for the perfection
of labour, credit essential to capital, and ingenuity
and mental energy a secure and dignified species
of property.</p>

<p>"Science, Gentlemen, is of infinitely more importance
to a state than may at first sight appear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
possible; for no source of wealth and power can be
entirely independent of it; and no class of men are
so well able to appreciate its advantages as that to
which I am now addressing myself. You have not
only derived from it the means of raising your subterraneous
wealth, but those also of rendering it
available to the public.</p>

<p>"Science alone has made pit-coal such an instrument
in the hands of the chemist and mechanic; it
has made the elements of fire and water perform
operations which formerly demanded human labour,
and it has converted the productions of the earth
into a thousand new forms of use and beauty.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, allow me to observe, in conclusion,
that it was in pursuing those methods of analogy
and experiment, by which mystery had become
science, that I was fortunately led to the invention
of the Safety-lamp. The whole progress of my researches
has been registered in the Transactions of
the Royal Society, in papers which that illustrious
body has honoured by their biennial medal;<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> in
which I can conscientiously assert, that I have gratefully
acknowledged even the slightest hints or offers
of assistance which I have received during their
composition.</p>

<p>"I state this, Gentlemen, not from vain-glory,
but on account of certain calumnious insinuations
which have arisen&mdash;not in the scientific world, for
to that the whole progress of my researches is well
known, but in a colliery. I must ever treat these
insinuations with contempt; and after the honest
indignation which has been expressed against them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
by the Coal-owners in general, I cannot feel any
anxiety on the subject, nor should I have referred
to it at all, did I not believe that the very persons
amongst whom these insinuations originated, were
extensively benefited by, and were constantly using
the invention they would seek to disparage. I
could never have expected that such persons would
have engaged their respectable connexions in mean
attempts to impeach the originality of a discovery,
given to them in the most disinterested manner,
and for which no return was required but an honest
acknowledgment of the benefit, founded upon truth
and justice.</p>

<p>"I do not envy them their feelings, particularly
at the present moment: I do not wish to enquire
into their motives: I do hope, however, that their
conduct has been prompted by ignorance rather
than by malevolence, by misapprehension rather
than by ingratitude.</p>

<p>"It was a new circumstance to me, that attempts
to preserve human life, and to prevent human misery,
should create hostile feelings in persons who
professed to have similar objects in view.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I have had some opposition, much
labour, and more anxiety, during the course of these
researches; but had the opposition, the labour, and
the anxiety been a thousand times as great, the
events of this day would have been more than a
compensation."</p>

<p>Sir Humphry, after drinking the health and happiness
of the company, proposed as a sentiment&mdash;"Prosperity
to the Coal-trade."</p>

<p>The healths of the Duke of Northumberland, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Bishop of Durham, and the Reverend Dr. Gray,
were drunk in succession.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock, Sir Humphry, accompanied by
the chairman, retired amidst the enthusiastic plaudits
of a meeting, the object of which being one of
convivial benevolence, the effect was that of unclouded
hilarity.</p>

<p>The party which had supported the claims of
Mr. Stephenson had also their meeting; and it was
held on the 1st of November. At this meeting it
was resolved," That it was the opinion of the persons
present, that Mr. G. Stephenson having discovered
the fact, that explosions of hydrogen gas will not
pass through tubes and apertures of small dimensions,
and having been the first to apply the principle
to the construction of a Safety-lamp, is entitled
to some reward."</p>

<p>A committee was accordingly formed to carry
this resolution into effect, at the head of which was
placed the name of the Earl of Strathmore.</p>

<p>The respectable body of Coal-owners, under whose
auspices the invention of Sir Humphry Davy had
been introduced and rewarded, felt that they owed
it to their own characters to repel assertions which
amounted to a charge against themselves of ingratitude
and injustice: a general meeting was accordingly
summoned, at the Assembly-rooms in Newcastle,
on the 26th of November 1817, J. G. Lambton,
Esq. M.P. in the chair&mdash;when it was resolved,</p>

<p>"That the Resolutions passed at the Meeting of
the friends of Mr. G. Stephenson on the 5th instant,
impugn the justice and propriety of the proceedings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
of a meeting of the Coal-trade on the 31st of August
1816:</p>

<p>"That the present meeting, therefore, feel themselves
called upon, as an act of justice to the character
of their great and disinterested benefactor,
Sir Humphry Davy, and as a proof that the Coal-trade
of the North in no way sanctions the resolutions
of Mr. Stephenson's friends, to state their decided
conviction, that the merit of having discovered
the fact, that explosions of fire-damp will not pass
through tubes and apertures of small dimensions,
and of having applied that principle to the construction
of a Safety-lamp, <em>belongs to Sir Humphry
Davy alone</em>.</p>

<p>"That this meeting is also decidedly of opinion,
from the evidence produced in various publications
by Mr. George Stephenson and his friends, subsequently
to the meeting of the Coal-trade which was
held on the 18th of March 1816, as well as from the
documents which have been read at this meeting,
that Mr. Stephenson <em>did not</em> discover the fact, that
explosions of fire-damp will not pass through tubes
and apertures of small dimensions; and that he <em>did
not</em> apply that principle to the construction of a
Safety-lamp; and that the latest lamps made by
Mr. Stephenson are evident imitations of those of
Sir Humphry Davy, and that, even with that advantage,
they are so imperfectly constructed as to be
actually unsafe.</p>

<p>"That the above resolutions be published thrice
in the Newcastle papers, and in the Courier, Morning
Chronicle, and Edinburgh Courant; and that
printed copies thereof be sent to the Lords Lieutenants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
of the two counties, to the Lord Bishop of
Durham, and to the principal owners and lessors of
collieries upon the Tyne and Wear."</p>

<p>The following letter from Sir Humphry Davy
announces the farther measures which he also had
thought proper to pursue, in order to counteract
the impression which the meeting of Mr. Stephenson's
friends might have produced on the less informed
part of the public.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO J. G. LAMBTON, ESQ. M.P.</p>

<p class="date">November 21, 1817.</p>

<p class="opening"><span class="smcap">MY DEAR SIR</span>,</p>

<p>I shall send off by this post a copy of the resolutions,
which will appear to-morrow in the Chronicle
and Courier.</p>

<p>The men of science who have signed these resolutions
are the first chemists and natural philosophers
of the country, with the President of the Royal
Society, the most illustrious body in Europe, at
their head.</p>

<p>It is disagreeable to be thus obliged to use artillery
for the destruction of bats and owls; but it
was necessary that something should be done.</p>

<p>The Messrs. &mdash;&mdash; have for a long time been endeavouring
to destroy my peace of mind; my offence
being that of conferring a benefit.</p>

<p>The only persons I knew in Newcastle, before I
gave the Safety-lamp to the Coal-owners, were Dr.
Headlam and Mr. Bigge, so that friends I had none;
and the few persons with whom I had a slight acquaintance,
and who were civil to me before I discovered
the Safety-lamp, became my enemies. It
requires a deep metaphysician to explain this&mdash;Can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
it be that I did not make them the medium of communication
to the colliers?&mdash;But I quit a subject to
which I have no desire to return, and shall only recollect
that day when your eloquence touched my
feelings more than it flattered my self-love.</p>

<p class="signature">Believe me, &amp;c. &amp;c.<br />
<span class="smcap j10">H. Davy</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>The following are the Resolutions of a Meeting
adverted to in the preceding letter, and which was
held "for considering the Facts relating to the Discovery
of the Lamp of Safety."</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="date">Soho Square, Nov. 20, 1817.</p>

<p>"An advertisement having been inserted in the
Newcastle Courant, of Saturday, November 7, 1817,
purporting to contain the Resolutions of 'A Meeting
held for the purpose of remunerating Mr. George
Stephenson, for the valuable service he has rendered
mankind by the invention of his Safety-lamp, which
is calculated for the preservation of human life in
situations of the greatest danger,'</p>

<p>"We have considered the evidence produced in
various publications by Mr. Stephenson and his
friends, in support of his claims; and having examined
his lamps, and enquired into their effects
in explosive mixtures, are clearly of opinion&mdash;</p>

<p>"First,&mdash;That Mr. George Stephenson <em>is not</em> the
author of the discovery of the fact, that an explosion
of inflammable gas will not pass through
tubes and apertures of small dimensions.</p>

<p>"Secondly,&mdash;That Mr. George Stephenson <em>was
not</em> the first to apply that principle to the construction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
of a Safety-lamp, none of the lamps which he
made in the year 1815 having been safe, and there
being no evidence even of their having been made
upon that principle.</p>

<p>"Thirdly,&mdash;That Sir Humphry Davy not only
discovered, independently of all others, and without
any knowledge of the unpublished experiments of
the late Mr. Tennant on Flame, the principle of
the non-communication of explosions through small
apertures, but that he has also the sole merit of
having first applied it to the very important purpose
of a Safety-lamp, which has evidently been
imitated in the latest lamps of Mr. George Stephenson.</p>

<p class="j4">(Signed)<span class="j2 smcap">"Joseph Banks</span>, P.R.S.<br />

<span class="smcap j5h">"Charles Hatchett</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap j5h">"William Hyde Wollaston</span>."
</p>
</div>

<p>Thus terminated a controversy, the discussion of
which, I am well aware, many of my readers will
consider as having been protracted to a tedious, and
perhaps to an unnecessary extent; but the biographer
had no alternative. In passing it by without
a notice, he would have violated his faith to the
public, have given a tacit acknowledgment of the
claims of Stephenson, and, in his judgment, have
committed an act of gross injustice to the illustrious
subject of his history; while by giving only an
abridged statement, he would have furnished a pretext
for doubt, and an opportunity for malevolence.</p>

<p>It is due also to Sir Humphry Davy to observe,
that had he practised more reserve in the communication
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
of his results, the spirit of rivalry would
have expired without a struggle,&mdash;for it derived its
only support and power from the generosity of its
victim. Had he secured for himself the advantages
of his invention by patent, he might have realized
wealth to almost any extent; but to barter the
products of his intellectual exertions for pecuniary
profit, was a course wholly at variance with every
feeling of Davy's mind; and we therefore find him,
in the advancement, as at the commencement of his
fleeting career, spurning the golden apples from his
feet, and hastening to the goal for that prize which
could alone reward all his labours&mdash;the meed of
immortal fame.</p>

<p>From a letter dated Newcastle, August 1830,
which I had the pleasure to receive from Mr. Buddle,
I extract the following interesting passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the autumn of 1815, Sir Humphry Davy
accompanied me into some of our fiery mines, to
<em>prove</em> the efficacy of his lamp. Nothing could be
more gratifying than the result of those experiments,
as they inspired every body with perfect
confidence in the security which his invention had
afforded.</p>

<p>"Sir Humphry was delighted, and I was overpowered
with feelings of gratitude to that great
genius which had produced it.</p>

<p>"I felt, however, that he did not contemplate
any pecuniary reward; and, in a private conversation,
I remonstrated with him on the subject. I
said, 'You might as well have secured this invention
by a patent, and received your five or ten thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
a-year from it.' The reply of this great and
noble-minded man was,&mdash;'No, my good friend, I
never thought of such a thing; my sole object was
to serve the cause of humanity; and, if I have succeeded,
I am amply rewarded in the gratifying reflection
of having done so.' I expostulated, saying,
that his ideas were much too philosophic and refined
for the occasion. He replied, 'I have enough for
all my views and purposes; more wealth might be
troublesome, and distract my attention from those
pursuits in which I delight;&mdash;more wealth,' he
added, 'could not increase either my fame or my
happiness. It might, undoubtedly, enable me to
put four horses to my carriage; but what would it
avail me to have it said that Sir Humphry drives
his carriage-and-four?'"</p>

<p>The present Bishop of Bristol, to whom the world
is so greatly indebted for having first called the
attention of Sir Humphry Davy to the subject of
explosions from fire-damp, and who has kindly interested
himself in my arduous and anxious undertaking,
was desirous to obtain for me the latest
accounts with respect to the Safety-lamp, as to the
constancy of its use, and the extent of its security;
and his Lordship informs me, that having applied to
Mr. Buddle and Mr. Fenwick for information upon
these points, their answers have been most satisfactory;
at the same time, his Lordship transmitted
me much valuable information, which was accompanied
by the following letter from Mr. Buddle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO THE RIGHT REVEREND THE LORD BISHOP<br />
OF BRISTOL.</p>

<p class="date">Wall's-End, August 11, 1830.</p>

<p class="opening"><span class="smcap">MY LORD</span>,</p>

<p>I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt
of your Lordship's letter of yesterday's date. I
am glad your Lordship has interested yourself in
Doctor Paris's work, and I hope that he will be
enabled, through the assistance of Sir Humphry's
friends, to do ample justice to the genius and worth
of that excellent man.</p>

<p>I should be very happy if any letters of mine
could assist Dr. Paris in doing justice to his merits
in the invention of the Safety-lamp; and I shall
with pleasure submit to your Lordship's better
judgment and discretion the selection of such of
them as may seem to be conducive to that object.</p>

<p>I do not find that any improvement whatever has
been made, either in the principle or construction of
the <em>original lamp</em>, as presented to us by Sir Humphry.
His transcendent genius seems to have anticipated
every thing belonging to the subject, and
has left nothing more to be done.</p>

</div>

<p>In consequence of some late reports of accidents in
the mines, I requested my friend Sir Cuthbert Sharp
to make certain enquiries in the mining districts;
and for this purpose, I sent him a string of queries,
to which I begged him to obtain answers. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
questions were submitted to Mr. Buddle, and they
produced the following letter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO SIR CUTHBERT SHARP.</p>

<p class="date">Newcastle, August 28, 1830.</p>

<p class="opening"><span class="smcap">MY DEAR SIR CUTHBERT</span>,</p>

<p>I return Dr. Paris's letter, and shall briefly
answer his enquiries.</p>

<p>If the Davy lamp was exclusively used, and due
care taken in its management, it is certain that few
accidents would occur in our coal mines; but the exclusive
use of the "<em>Davy</em>" is not compatible with the
working of many of our mines, in consequence of
their not being workable without the aid of gunpowder.</p>

<p>In such mines, where every collier must necessarily
fire, on the average, two <em>shots</em> a-day, we are exposed
to the risk of explosion from the ignition of
the gunpowder, even if no naked lights were used in
carrying on the ordinary operations of the mine.</p>

<p>This was the case in Jarrow Colliery, at the time
the late accident happened. As the use of gunpowder
was indispensable, naked lights were generally
used, and the accident was occasioned by a '<em>bag</em>' of
inflammable air forcing out a large block of coal, in
the face of a drift, from a fissure in which it had
been pent up, perhaps from the Creation, and firing
at the first naked light with which it came in contact,
after having been diluted down to the combustible
point by a due admixture of atmospheric air.</p>

<p>As to the number of old collieries and old workings
which have been renovated, and as to the quantity
of coal which has been, and will be saved to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
public by the invention of the "<em>Davy</em>," it is scarcely
possible to give an account, or to form an estimate.</p>

<p>In this part of the country, 'Walker's Colliery,'
after having been completely worked out, according
to the former system, with candles and steel-mills,
and after having been abandoned in 1811, was reopened
in 1818 by the aid of the "<em>Davy</em>" and has
been worked on an extensive scale ever since, and
may continue to be worked for an almost indefinite
period.</p>

<p>Great part of the formerly relinquished workings
of Wall's-end, Willington, Percy-main, Hebburn,
Jarrow, Elswick, Benwell, &amp;c. &amp;c., as well as several
collieries on the Wear, have been recovered,
and are continued in work by the invention of the
"<em>Davy</em>."</p>

<p>If I had only what you know perfectly well I have
not&mdash;<span class="smcap">Time</span>, I could write a volume on this subject.</p>

<p>I shall shortly, through the medium of a friend,
get an important paper on the subject of the "<em>Davy</em>,"
put into Dr. Paris's hands.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Bristol has placed at my disposal
a communication from Mr. Fenwick, a gentleman
of much practical ability, which affords additional
evidence of the utility of the lamp; from
which the following is an extract.</p>

<p>"Sir H. Davy's safety-lamp has afforded much
security in the general working of mines, particularly
by enabling the coal-owner to work, in several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
situations, the pillars of coal formerly left therein,
which, under the system of working by candles,
or open flame, was deemed hazardous and impracticable;
and, in consequence, one-sixth part more
of coal may be estimated as obtainable from those
mines which are subject to hydrogen gas. Also
in the working of the pillars of coal, (commonly
called the second working,) great advantages and
securities, as well as saving of expenses, have resulted
from the use of this lamp, not only to the
lessees of collieries, inasmuch as more coal is obtained
from a given space than before, (particularly
in collieries subject to fire-damp,) but also to the
lessor of such mines, by their being more productive,
and of course more durable than heretofore.</p>

<p>"Another advantage results from the use of this
Safety-lamp, and in the working of the pillars in
particular. It is found now, through experience,
that the changeable state of the atmosphere, which
our barometers daily indicate, has a most powerful
effect on the noxious air in mines; as, from a
sudden change in the atmosphere, indicated by the
rapid fall of the mercury in the barometrical tube, a
rapid discharge of noxious gas into the workings
and excavations of the mine is the consequence,
caused by the want of the atmospheric equilibrium:<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
in which case the mine becomes suddenly surcharged
with hydrogen, and if worked by the light of
<em>open flame</em>, an explosion may take place before the
possibility of such a circumstance can even be suspected;
but if worked by the Safety-lamp, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
only shown by the gas in the lamp becoming a
pillar of harmless flame. This circumstance frequently
takes place when any atmospheric change
causes the mercury in the barometer to sink to
twenty-eight inches and a half or thereabouts."</p>

<p>In the year 1825, Sir Humphry Davy had the
honour to receive from the Emperor Alexander of
Russia, a superb silver gilt vase, standing in a circular
tray enriched with medallions. On the cover
was a figure, of about sixteen or eighteen inches in
height, representing the God of Fire, weeping over
his extinguished torch.</p>

<p>The circumstances under which this vase was presented
have been communicated to me by Mr. Smirnove,
Secretary to the Embassy.</p>

<p class="center">TO J. A. PARIS, M.D.</p>

<p class="date">Wigmore Street, May 29, 1830.</p>

<p class="opening"><span class="smcap">DEAR SIR</span>,</p>

<p>It was in the month of April, or May, 1815, that
the late Sir Humphry Davy expressed to Prince,
then Count, Lieven, his wish to offer to the Emperor
of Russia a model of his Safety-lamp, which he
had recently improved, accompanied by an explanatory
pamphlet on the subject.</p>

<p>Prince Lieven of course complied with this request;
and the Emperor having been pleased to
accept it, ordered the Ambassador, in November of
the same year, to thank Sir Humphry for it in his
Majesty's name, and to assure him how much his
Majesty appreciated the merit of an invention, the
double effect of which was to favour the progress of
more than one branch of industry, and to ensure the
safety of persons employed in the coal-mines, against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
those fatal accidents which had hitherto so frequently
occurred. The Ambassador, at the same time, delivered
to Sir Humphry a silver-gilt Vase,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> in the
name of the Emperor, in testimony of the high satisfaction
with which that sovereign had been pleased
to accept the object in question. I beg you to believe

<p>It is well known to the friends of Davy, that in
his conversation as well as in his correspondence, he
always dwelt with peculiar satisfaction and delight
upon the invention of his Safety-lamp.</p>

<p>Mr. Poole, in a letter lately addressed to me, observes&mdash;"How
often have I heard him express the
satisfaction which this discovery had given him. 'I
value it,' said he, 'more than any thing I ever did.
It was the result of a great deal of investigation and
labour; but, if my directions be only attended to, it
will save the lives of thousands of poor labourers.
I was never more affected,' he added, 'than by a
written address which I received from the working
colliers, when I was in the North, thanking me, in
behalf of themselves and their families, for the preservation
of their lives.' I remember how delighted
he was when he showed me the service of plate
presented to him by those very men and their
employers, as a testimony of their gratitude."</p>

<p>It is very long since any letters have passed between

think you will not be displeased at being put in
mind that there is an old friend not very far from
you, who will be very glad to see you.</p>

<p>Bath does not suit me much, nor should I remain
here, but my wife has been indisposed, and the
waters seem to benefit her, and promise to render
her permanent service, and if that happens, I shall
be pleased even with this uninteresting city.</p>

<p>I have seen many countries and nations since we
met.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>I have just come from the North of England,
where it has pleased Providence to make me an instrument
for preserving the lives of some of my fellow-creatures.
You, I know, are of that complexion
of mind that the civic crown will please you more
than even the victor's laurel wreath.</p>

<p>I have a bed, though a small one, at your service;
if you can come here for two or three days, I assure
you we shall be most happy to see you. We shall
remain in Bath about three weeks. I shall be absent
for a few days in the beginning of next week,

<p>The late melancholy event<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> has thrown a gloom
over London, and indeed over England. The public
feeling is highly creditable to the moral tone of

<p>The loss of a Princess, known only by good

awful one.</p>

<p>I go on always labouring in my vocation. I am
now at work on a subject almost as interesting as
the last which I undertook. It is too much to hope
for the same success; at least I will deserve it.</p>

<p>When you come to town in the spring, which I
trust you will do, I shall show you my service of

</div>

<p>In a strictly scientific point of view, the most interesting
results which have arisen out of the investigation
for constructing a Safety-lamp, are perhaps
those which have made us better acquainted with the
true nature of flame, and the circumstances by
which it is modified; and which have led to some
practical views connected with the useful arts.</p>

<p>It is, I think, impossible to enter into the details
of those curious investigations<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> which, under the
title of "Some Researches on Flame," were communicated
to the Royal Society, and read before that
body on the 16th of January 1817, without being
forcibly struck with the address by which Davy, in
the first instance, brought abstract science to promote
and extend practical knowledge; and then, as
it were by a species of multiplied reflection, applied
the new facts thus elicited for the farther extension
of speculative truth; which in its wider range became
again instrumental in disclosing a fresh store of
useful facts. It may be said to have been the power
of dexterously combining such methods which constituted
the felicity of his genius; for, in general,
each of them requires for its successful application
a mind of quite a distinct order and construction.
Mr. Babbage has very justly observed, that those
intellectual qualifications which give birth to new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
principles or to new methods, are of quite a different
order from those which are necessary for their practical
application. Davy furnished the exception
that was necessary to make good the rule.</p>

<p>He detects, in the first instance, the general principle
of inflammable gas, in a state of combustion,
being arrested in its progress by capillary tubes; he
next applies it to the construction of a Safety-lamp,
and then, by observing the phenomena which this
lamp exhibits, is led to novel views respecting the
nature and properties of flame.&mdash;I shall endeavour
to offer a popular view of the curious and interesting
truths disclosed by this latter research.</p>

<p>He had observed that, when the coal gas burnt in
the iron cage, its colour was pale, and its light
feeble; whereas the fact is rendered familiar to us
all by the flame of the gas lights, that in the open
air carburetted hydrogen burns with great brilliancy.
Upon reflecting on the circumstances of the two
species of combustion, he was led to believe that the
cause of the superiority of the light in the latter
case might be owing to a <em>decomposition</em> of a part of
the gas towards the interior of the flame, where the
air was in the smallest quantity; and that the consequent
deposition of charcoal might first by its <em>ignition</em>,
and afterwards by its <em>combustion</em>, contribute to
this increase of light. A conjecture which he immediately
verified by experiment.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
The intensity therefore of the light of flames depends
principally upon the production and ignition
of <em>solid</em> matter in combustion, so that heat and light
are in this process independent phenomena.</p>

<p>These facts, Davy observes, appear to admit of
many applications; in explaining, for instance, the
appearance of different flames&mdash;in suggesting the
means of increasing or diminishing their light, and
in deducing from their characters a knowledge of
the composition of their constituent parts.</p>

<p>The point of the inner blue flame of a candle or
lamp urged by the blow-pipe, where the heat is the
greatest and the light the least, is the point where
the whole of the charcoal is burnt in its gaseous combinations,
without previous ignition. The flames of
phosphorus and of zinc in oxygen, and that of potassium
in chlorine, afford examples of intensity of
light depending upon the production of <em>fixed</em> solid
matter in combustion; while on the contrary, the feebleness
of the light of those flames, in which gaseous
and volatile matter is alone produced, is well illustrated
by those of hydrogen and sulphur in oxygen,
or by that of phosphorus in chlorine.</p>

<p>From such facts, he is inclined to think that the
luminous appearance of shooting stars and meteors
cannot be owing to any inflammation of gas, but
must depend upon the ignition of solid matter. Dr.
Halley calculated the height of a meteor at ninety
miles, and the great American meteor, which threw
down showers of stones, was estimated at only seventeen
miles high. The velocity of the motion of such
bodies must in all cases be immensely great, and the
heat thus produced by the compression of the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
rarefied air, Davy thinks, must be sufficient to ignite
the mass; and that all the phenomena may be
explained by assuming that <em>falling stars</em> are small
solid bodies moving round the earth in very eccentric
orbits, which become ignited only when they
pass with immense velocity through the upper regions
of the atmosphere, and which, when they contain
either combustible or elastic matter, throw out
stones with explosion.</p>

<p>By the application of such a principle did he also
infer the composition of a body from the character
of its flame: thus, says he, Ether, during its combustion,
would appear to indicate the presence of
<em>olefiant gas</em>. Alcohol burns with a flame similar to
that of a mixture of carbonic oxide and hydrogen;
so that the first is probably a binary compound of
olefiant gas and water, and the second of carbonic
oxide and hydrogen.</p>

<p>When the proto-chloride of copper is introduced
into the flame of a candle or lamp, it affords a peculiar
dense and brilliant red light, tinged with green
and blue towards the edges, which seems to depend
upon the separation of the chlorine from the copper
by the hydrogen, and the ignition and combustion
of the solid copper and charcoal.</p>

<p>The acknowledged fact of the brightest flames
yielding the least heat is easily reconciled, when
we learn that the light depends upon fixed matter
which carries off the heat. It is equally obvious,
that by art we may, for practical purposes, easily
modify these phenomena.</p>

<p>In the next place, having observed that wire-gauze
cooled down flame beyond its combustible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
point, he was led to enquire into the nature of pure
flame; and he readily demonstrated it to be <em>gaseous
matter heated so highly as to be luminous</em>; and that
the temperature necessary for such an effect was
much greater than had been imagined, varying,
however, in different cases. The flame of a common
lamp he proved, by a very simple experiment,
to exceed even the white heat of solid bodies, and
which is easily shown by the simple fact of heating
a piece of platinum wire over the chimney of an
Argand lamp fed with spirit of wine; when it will
be seen that air, which is not of sufficient temperature
to appear luminous, is still sufficiently hot
to impart a white heat to a solid body immersed
in it.</p>

<p>The fact of different gaseous bodies requiring different
degrees of heat to raise them into flame, was
an inference immediately deducible from the phenomena
of his <em>safety gauze</em>. A tissue of one hundred
apertures to the square inch, made of wire of
one-sixtieth, will, at common temperatures, intercept
the flame of a spirit-lamp, but not that of
hydrogen; and, when strongly heated, it will no
longer arrest the flame of the spirit-lamp. A
tissue which, when red-hot, will not interrupt the
flame of hydrogen, will still intercept that of olefiant
gas; and a heated tissue, which would communicate
explosion from a mixture of olefiant gas
and air, will stop an explosion of fire-damp. Fortunately
for the success of the Safety-lamp, carburetted
hydrogen requires so high a temperature to
carry on its combustion, that even metal, when
white-hot, is far below it; and hence red-hot gauze,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
in sufficient quantity, and of the proper degree of
fineness, will abstract heat enough from the flame
to extinguish it.</p>

<p>The discovery of the high temperature which is
necessary for the maintenance of flame, suggested
to the philosopher the reason of its extinction under
various circumstances. He considers, that the common
operation of blowing out a candle principally
depends upon the cooling power of the current of
air projected into the flame;<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and he observes, that
the hottest flames are those which are least easily
blown out. He farther illustrated this subject by
surrounding a very small flame with a ring of <em>metal</em>,
which had the effect of cooling it so far as to extinguish
it; but a ring of <em>glass</em>, of similar dimensions
and diameter, being a less perfect conductor of heat,
produced no such effect.</p>

<p>It had been long known that flame ceased to
burn in highly rarefied air; but the degree of rarefaction
necessary for this effect had been very differently
stated. The cause of the phenomenon was
generally supposed to depend upon a deficiency of
oxygen.</p>

<p>In the commencement of his enquiry into this
subject, Davy observed that the flame of hydrogen
gas, the degree of rarefaction and the quantity of
air being the same, burnt longer when it issued
from a larger than a smaller jet,&mdash;a fact the very
reverse of that which must have happened had the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
flame expired for want of oxygen; he moreover
observed, that when the larger jet was used, the
point of the glass tube became white-hot, and continued
red-hot till the flame was extinguished: he
therefore concluded, that the heat communicated to
the gas by this tube was the cause of its protracted
combustion, and that <em>flame expired in rarefied air,
not for want of nourishment from oxygen, but for
want of heat, and that if its temperature could be
preserved by some supplementary aid, the flame might
be kept burning</em>. The experiment by which he confirmed
this theory was as beautiful as it was satisfactory.</p>

<p>He burnt a piece of camphor in a <em>glass</em> tube,
under the receiver of an air-pump, so as to make
the upper part of the tube red-hot; its inflammation
was found to continue when the rarefaction
was nine times; but by repeating the experiment
in a <em>metallic</em> tube, which could not be so considerably
heated by it, it ceased after the rarefaction exceeded
six times.</p>

<p>It follows then that by artificially imparting
heat,<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> bodies may be made to burn in a rarefied air,
when under other circumstances they would be extinguished.</p>

<p>The following may be considered as an <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">experimentum</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">crucis</i>, in proof of the fact that combustibility
is neither increased nor diminished by rarefaction.</p>

<p>He introduced the flame of hydrogen, in which
was inserted a platinum wire, into a receiver of rarefied
air, and he found that, as long as the metal remained
at a dull red-heat, the flame continued to
burn: now it so happens that the temperature, at
which platinum approaches a red-heat, is precisely
that at which hydrogen inflames under the ordinary
pressure of the atmosphere; whence it follows,
that its combustibility is not altered by rarefaction.</p>

<p>The same law was found to apply to the flames
of other bodies; those requiring the least heat for
their combustion always sustaining the greater rarefaction
without being extinguished.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>Hitherto he had only considered the effects of
rarefaction, when produced by the diminution of
pressure; he had next to investigate the phenomena
of rarefaction when occasioned by expansion
from heat.</p>

<p>The experiments of M. de Grotthus had apparently
shown that rarefaction by heat destroys the
combustibility of gaseous mixtures; those of Davy,
however, proved that it enables them to explode at
a lower temperature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
In the progress of this research, while passing
mixtures of hydrogen and oxygen through heated
tubes, the heat being still below redness, he observed
that steam was formed without any combustion.</p>

<p>Here was a slow combination without combustion,
as long since observed with respect to hydrogen and
chlorine, and oxygen and metals; and he believes
that such a phenomenon will happen at certain temperatures
with most substances that unite by heat.
On trying charcoal, he found that at a temperature
which appeared to be a little above the boiling
point of quicksilver, it converted oxygen pretty
rapidly into carbonic acid, without any luminous
appearance, and that, at a dull red-heat, the elements
of olefiant gas combined in a similar manner with
oxygen, slowly and without explosion.</p>

<p>It occurred to Davy, in the progress of these experiments,
that, during this species of slow combination,
although the increase of temperature might
not be sufficient to render the gaseous matters luminous,
or to produce flame, it might still be adequate
to ignite solid matters exposed to them. It was
while engaged in devising experiments to ascertain
this fact, that he was accidentally led to the discovery
of the continued ignition of platinum wire,
during the slow combination of coal gas with atmospheric
air; the circumstances of which have been
already related, as well as the curious invention to
which the application of the fact gave origin.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>For this and his preceding papers on the subjects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
of flame and combustion, the President and Council
of the Royal Society adjudged to Sir Humphry
Davy the gold and silver medals, on the donation
of Count Rumford;<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and never, I will venture say,
did a society in awarding a prize more faithfully
comply with the intentions of its founder.</p>

<p>On the completion of these laborious enquiries, it
was thought expedient to give a wider circulation
to their results than the publication of them in the
Philosophical Transactions was calculated to afford;
and Sir Humphry Davy was therefore induced to reprint
his principal memoirs, so as to form an octavo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
volume,<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> which might be accessible to the practical
parts of the community.</p>

<p>The enlightened friends of science very reasonably
expected that a service of such importance to society
as the invention of the Safety-lamp, would
have commanded the gratitude of the State, and obtained
for its author a high parliamentary reward;
nor were there wanting zealous and disinterested
persons to urge the claims of the Philosopher: but a
Government which had bestowed a splendid pension
upon the contriver of an engine<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> for the destruction
of human life, refused to listen to any proposition
for the reward of one who had invented a machine
for its preservation. It is true that, in consideration
of various scientific services, they tardily and
inadequately acknowledged the claims of Davy, by
bestowing upon him the dignity of Baronetcy<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>&mdash;a
reward, it must be confessed, that neither displayed
any regard to his condition, nor implied the just estimate
of his merits. The measure of value, however,
enables us to judge of the standard by which
the State rates the various services to society; and
deeply is it to be lamented that the disproportioned
exaltation of military achievement, crowned with
the highest honours, depresses respect for science,
and raises a false and fruitless object of ambition.</p>

<p>The passion for arms is a relict of barbarity derived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
from the feudal ages; the progress of civilization,
and the cultivation of the mind, should
have led us to prefer intellectual to physical superiority,
and to recognise in the successes of science
the chief titles to honour. This reversal of the objects
of importance can never be redressed until the
aristocracy shall be possessed of a competent share
of scientific knowledge, and instructed to appreciate
its value. To effect such a change, the system of
education so blindly and obstinately continued in
our great public schools, must be altered; for
minds exclusively applied to classical pursuits, and
trained to recognise no other objects of liberal study,
are indisposed and indeed disqualified for enquiries
ministering to the arts of life, and arrogantly despised
for their very connexion with utility. It is
in the early ignorance of the rudiments of science
that the after negligence of science has its source.</p>

<p>The instances in proof of the extent of the ignorance
and indifference I have noted, and of their
pernicious effects upon the most important interests
of society, especially legislation, and the administration
of justice, are abundant. In Parliament, how
is a question of science treated? In our courts of
law, and criminal investigation, it is lamentable to
observe the frequent defeat of justice, arising from
erroneous conception, or from the utter absence of
the requisite knowledge. In the ordinary affairs
of life, we see conspicuous, amongst the dupes of
quackery and imposture, those whose stations should
imply the best instruction, and whose conduct, unfortunately,
has the effect of example.</p>

<p>A contempt far-spreading, and proceeding from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
the well-springs of truth, is rapidly rising against
this exalted ignorance; the industrious classes of
society are daily becoming more imbued with knowledge
upon scientific subjects, and the nobility, if
they would preserve their superiority in social consideration,
must descend to the popular improvement.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>Before concluding the present chapter, I must
carry back my history to the year 1815, for the
purpose of recording a circumstance in the life of
Davy, which, while it exemplifies his general love
of science, evinces the local attachment he retained
for the town of his birth.</p>

<p>In the year 1813, the Geological Society of
Cornwall was established at Penzance. Its objects
are to cultivate the sciences of Mineralogy and
Geology, in a district better calculated perhaps for
such pursuits than any other spot in Europe,&mdash;to
register the new facts which are continually presenting
themselves in the mines, and to place upon
permanent record, the history of phenomena which
had hitherto been entrusted to oral tradition; but,
above all, its object was to bring science in alliance
with art; to prevent the accidents which had so
frequently occurred from explosion in the operation
of blasting rocks; and, in short, to render all
the resources of speculative truth subservient to the
ends of practical improvement.</p>

<p>No sooner had the establishment of so useful an
institution been communicated to Davy, than he
testified his zeal for its welfare by a handsome donation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
to its funds; which was followed by a present
of a very extensive suite of specimens, illustrative
of the volcanic district of Naples, and which
had been collected by himself. He also afterwards
communicated to the Society a memoir on the Geology
of Cornwall, which has been published in the
first volume of its Transactions.</p>

<p>In this paper, he discusses several of the more
difficult questions connected with the origin of
veins.</p>

<p>He first observed the granitic veins, which have
called forth so much attention from geologists,
about the year 1797; probably before they had excited
much scientific notice: he is disposed to regard
them as peculiar to the low metalliferous granite
and mica formations; he had seen several cases
of granite veins near Dublin, in the Isle of Arran,
and in other parts of Scotland; he had also observed
several instances near Morlaix in Brittany,
but he had in vain searched for them in the points
of junction of the schist and granite, both in the
Maritime, Savoy, Swiss, and Tyrolese Alps, and
likewise in the Oriental Pyrenees.</p>

<p>The <em>serpentine</em> district of Cornwall, he thinks, has
not yet met with the attention it deserves. "I
have seen no formation," says he, "in which the
nature of serpentine is so distinctly displayed. The
true constituent parts of this rock appear to be <em>resplendent
hornblende</em> and <em>felspar</em>; it appears to differ
from <em>sienite</em> only in the nature of the <em>hornblende</em>,
and in the chemical composition of its parts, and in
being intersected by numerous veins of <em>steatite</em> and
<em>calcareous spar</em>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
The nature and origin of the veins of <em>steatite</em> in
serpentine, he considers as offering a very curious
subject for enquiry. "Were they originally crystallized,"
he asks, "and the result of chemical deposition?
or have they been, as for the most part they
are now found, mere mechanical deposits?" He is
inclined to the latter opinion. The felspar in serpentine,
he observes, is very liable to decomposition,
probably from the action of carbonic acid and water
on its alkaline, calcareous, and magnesian elements;
and its parts washed down by water and deposited
in the chasms of the rocks, he thinks would necessarily
gain that kind of loose aggregation belonging
to steatite.</p>

<p>He had some years before made a rude, comparative
analysis of the felspar in serpentine, and of the
soap-rock, when he found the same constituents in
both of them, except that there was not any alkali
or calcareous earth in the latter substance. It is
very difficult to conceive, he says, that steatite was
originally a crystallized substance which has been
since decomposed; for, in that case, it ought to be
found in its primitive state in veins which are excluded
from the action of air and water; whereas it
is easy to account for the hardness of some species
of steatite on the former hypothesis; for mere mechanical
deposits, when very finely divided, and very
slowly made, adhere with a very considerable degree
of force. A remarkable instance of this kind occurred
to him amongst the chemical preparations of
the late Mr. Cavendish, which, on the decease of
that illustrious philosopher, had been presented to
him by Lord George Cavendish: there was a bottle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
which had originally contained a solution of silica
by potash; the cork, during the lapse of years, had
become decayed, and the carbonic acid of the atmosphere
had gradually precipitated the earth, so
that it was found in a state of solid cohesion; the
upper part was as soft as the steatite, but the lower
portion was extremely hard, was broken with some
difficulty, and presented an appearance similar to
that of chalcedony.</p>

<p>In speaking generally of the mineralogical interest
of Cornwall, he observes, that "it may be regarded,
&#954;&#945;&#964;' &#949;&#958;&#959;&#967;&#951;&#957;, as the country of veins; and that
it is in veins that the most useful as well as the
most valuable minerals generally exist, that the
pure specimens are found which serve to determine
the mineralogical species, and that the appearances
seem most interesting in their connexion with geological
theory. Thus veins, which now may be
considered in the light of the most valuable cabinets
of nature, were once her most active laboratories;
and they are equally important to the practical
miner, and to the mineralogical philosopher."</p>

<p>With regard to the general conformation of Cornwall,
he states it to be in the highest degree curious,
and he considers that the facts which it offers are
illustrative of many important points of geological
theory. "It exhibits very extraordinary instances
of rocks broken in almost every direction, but principally
from east to west, and filled with veins again
broken in, diversified by cross lines, and filled with
other veins, and exhibiting marks of various successive
phenomena of this kind.</p>

<p>"Respecting the agents that produced the chasms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
in the primary strata, and the power by which they
were filled with stony and metallic matter, it would
be easy to speculate, but very difficult to reason by
legitimate philosophical induction."</p>

<p>In the concluding passage, however, he very freely
admits his preference for the doctrine of fire.</p>

<p>"It is amongst extinct volcanoes, the surfaces of
which have been removed by the action of air and
water, and in which the interior parts of strata of
lavas are exposed, that the most instructive examples
of the operation of slow cooling upon heated masses
are to be found. It is difficult to conceive that water
could have been the solvent of the different granitic
and porphyritic formations; for, in that case, some
combinations of water with the pure earths ought to
be found in them. Quartz ought to exist in a state
of <em>hydrate</em>, and Wavellite, not Corundum, ought to
be the state of alumina in granite.</p>

<p>"To suppose the primary rocks, in general, to have
been produced by the slow cooling of a mass formed
by the combustion of the metallic bases of the earths,
appears to me the most reasonable hypothesis; yet
aqueous agency must not be entirely excluded from
our geological views. In many cases of crystallization,
even in volcanic countries, this cause operates;
thus in Ischia, siliceous <em>tufas</em> are formed from hot
springs; and in the lake Albula, or the lake of Solfaterra,
near Tivoli, crystals of calcareous spar and of
sulphur separate from water impregnated with carbonic
acid and hepatic gas; and large strata of calcareous
rocks, formed evidently in late times by
water impregnated with carbonic acid, exist in various
parts of Europe. The Travertine marble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
(<em>Marmor Tiburtinum</em>) is a production of this kind;
and it is of this species of stone that the Colosseum at
Rome, and the cathedral of St. Peter, are built. It
is likewise employed in the ancient temple of Pæstum,
and it rivals in durability, if not in beauty, the
primary marble of Paris and Carrara."</p>

<p>Our history now proceeds to exhibit Sir Humphry
Davy in quite a new field of enquiry;&mdash;engaged
in investigating, amidst the ruins of Herculaneum,
the nature and effects of the volcanic eruption
which overwhelmed that city in the reign
of Titus; and in attempting, by the resources of
modern science, to unfold and to render legible the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
mouldering archives which have been recovered
from its excavations, and deposited in the Museum
at Naples.</p>

<p>Having witnessed the unsuccessful attempts of
Dr. Sickler to unroll some of the Herculaneum manuscripts,
it occurred to him that a chemical examination
of their nature, and of the changes they had
undergone, might suggest some method of separating
the leaves from each other, and of rendering
legible the characters impressed upon them. On
communicating this opinion to Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt,
he immediately placed at his disposal fragments
which had been operated upon by Mr. Hayter
and by Dr. Sickler: at the same time, Dr. Young
presented him with some small pieces, which he
himself had formerly attempted to unroll.</p>

<p>Davy was very soon convinced by the products
of their distillation, that the nature of these manuscripts
had been generally misunderstood; that they
had not, as was usually supposed, been carbonized
by the operation of fire, but were in a state analogous
to peat, or to Bovey coal, the leaves being
generally cemented into one mass by a peculiar
substance which had formed, during the fermentation
and chemical change of the vegetable matter
composing them, in a long course of ages. The nature
of this substance being once known, the destruction
of it would become a subject of obvious
chemical investigation.</p>

<p>It occurred to him, that as chlorine and iodine do
not exert any action upon pure carbonaceous substances,
while they possess a strong attraction for
hydrogen, these bodies might probably be applied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
with success for the purpose of destroying the adhesive
matter, without the possibility of injuring
the letters of the Papyri, the ink of the ancients, as
it is well known, being composed of charcoal. He
accordingly exposed a fragment of a brown manuscript,
in which the layers were strongly adherent,
to an atmosphere of chlorine; there was an immediate
action, the papyrus smoked, and became yellow,
and the letters appeared much more distinct.
After which, by the application of heat, the layers
separated from each other, and fumes of muriatic
acid were evolved. The vapour of iodine had a
less distinct, but still a very sensible action. By
the simple application of heat to a fragment in a
close vessel filled with carbonic acid, or with the
vapour of ether, so regulated as to raise the temperature
very gradually, and as gradually to reduce
it, there was a marked improvement in the texture
of the papyrus, and its leaves were more easily unrolled.
In all these preliminary trials, however, he
found that the success of the experiment absolutely
depended upon the nicety with which the temperature
was regulated.</p>

<p>Different papyri having exhibited different appearances,
he concluded that the same process would
not apply in all cases; but even a partial success
he considered as a step gained, and it served to increase
his anxiety to examine in detail the numerous
specimens preserved in the Museum at Naples,
as well as to visit the excavations that still remained
open at Herculaneum.</p>

<p>Mr. Hamilton, to whom these views were communicated,
with that ardour which belongs to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
character, entered warmly into a plan which might
enable Sir Humphry Davy to accomplish his objects;
and on his representation of them, the Earl
of Liverpool and Viscount Castlereagh placed at his
disposal such funds as were requisite for paying the
persons whom it was necessary to engage in the
process.</p>

<p>At the same time, Sir Humphry Davy had the
honour of an audience of his late Majesty, then
Prince Regent; and on witnessing the results, his
Royal Highness was pleased to express his approbation,
and graciously condescended to patronize
the undertaking. Exulting in the prospect of success,
and sanguine as to the importance of its results
to literature, Davy embarked at Dover for the Continent,
in order to proceed to Naples, on the 26th of
May 1818.</p>

<p>During his journey, he was engaged in making
observations on the comparative temperature of air
incumbent upon land and water, with a view to
account for the formation of mists over the beds of
rivers and lakes. The results of this enquiry were
embodied in a memoir, which was read before the
Royal Society on the 25th of February 1819, and
published in the Philosophical Transactions of that
year. This paper, while it records the course of his
observations, informs us of the direction of his route
to the southern shores of Italy.</p>

<p>On the 31st of May, while passing along the
Rhine from Cologne to Coblentz, we find him examining
the relative temperature of the air, and of
the water of that river. On the 9th, 10th, and 11th
of June, he was making similar observations on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
the Danube, during a voyage from Ratisbonne to
Vienna. On the 11th of July, he was similarly
engaged on the Raab, near Kermond in Hungary.
In the end of August he was on the Save in Carniola;
in the middle of September on the Ironzo in
the Friul; in the end of that month, on the Po,
near Ferrara; and in the beginning of October, repeatedly
on the Tiber, and on the small lakes in the
Campagna of Rome, extending and multiplying his
observations upon the formation of mists: from the
results of which he established the law, that the
formation of mist, on a river or lake, never takes
place, if the temperature of the water be lower than
that of the atmosphere; not even though the latter
should be even saturated with vapour.</p>

<p>Possessed of this fact, he was enabled to explain
a phenomenon which all persons who have been accustomed
to the observation of Nature must have
frequently witnessed, although it had never yet
been philosophically explained, nor even fully discussed,
viz.&mdash;the formation of mists over the beds
of rivers and lakes, in calm and clear weather, after
sunset.</p>

<p>Sir Humphry Davy thinks that whoever has considered
the phenomena in relation to the radiation
and communication of heat and nature of vapour,
since the publication of the researches of MM.
Rumford, Leslie, Dalton, and Wells, can scarcely
have failed to discover their true causes.</p>

<p>"As soon as the sun has disappeared from any
part of the globe, the surface begins to lose heat by
radiation, and in greater proportions as the sky is
clearer; but the land and water are cooled by this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
operation in a very different manner: the impression
of cooling on the land is limited to the surface,
and very slowly transmitted to the interior; whereas
in water above 45° Fah., as soon as the upper
stratum is cooled, whether by radiation or evaporation,
it sinks in the mass of fluid, and its place is
supplied by warmer water from below, and till the
temperature of the whole mass is reduced nearly to
40°, the surface cannot be the coolest part.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> It follows,
therefore, that wherever water exists in considerable
masses, and has a temperature nearly equal
to that of the land, or only a few degrees below it,
and above 45° at sunset, its surface during the night,
in calm and clear weather, will be warmer than that
of the contiguous land; and the air above the land
will necessarily be colder than that above the water;
and when they both contain their due proportion of
aqueous vapour, and the situation of the ground is
such as to permit the cold air from the land to mix
with the warmer air above the water, mist or fog
will be the result; which will be so much the greater
in quantity, as the land surrounding or inclosing the
water is higher, the water deeper, and the temperature
of the water, which will coincide with the
quantity or strength of vapour in the air above it,
greater."</p>

<p>It will be remembered, that the rivers Inn and
Ilz flow into the Danube below Passau; a circumstance
which afforded Davy an excellent opportunity
of confirming, by observation and experiment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
the truth of his theory. On examining the
temperature of these rivers, at six o'clock <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>
June 11, that of the Danube was found to be 62°,
that of the Inn 56.5°, and that of the Ilz 56°: the
temperature of the atmosphere on the banks, where
their streams mixed, was 54°. The whole surface of
the Danube was covered with a thick fog; on the
Inn there was a slight mist; and on the Ilz barely a
haziness, indicating the deposition of a very small
quantity of water. About one hundred yards below
the conflux of the rivers, the temperature of
the central part of the Danube was 59°; and here
the quantity of mist was less than on the bed of the
Danube before the junction; but about half a mile
below, the warmer water had again found its place
at the surface, and the mist was as copious as before
the union of the three rivers.</p>

<p>After mists have been formed above rivers and
lakes, Davy considers that their increase may not
only depend upon the constant operation of the
cause which originally produced them, but likewise
upon the radiation of heat from the superficial particles
of water composing the mist, which produces
a descending current of cold air in the very body of
the mist, while the warm water continually sends
up vapour. It is to these circumstances, he says,
that the phenomena must be ascribed of mists from
a river or lake sometimes arising considerably above
the surrounding hills. He informs us that he had
frequently witnessed such an appearance during the
month of October, after very still and very clear
nights, in the Campagna of Rome above the Tiber,
and on Monte Albano, over the lakes existing in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
the ancient craters of this extinguished volcano;
and in one instance, on the 17th of October, before
sunrise, there not being a breath of wind, a dense
white cloud, of a pyramidal form, was seen on the
site of Alban Lake, and rising far above the highest
peak of the mountain. Its form gradually changed
after sunrise; its apex first disappeared, and its
body, as it were, melted away in the sunbeams.</p>

<p>Great dryness of the air, or a current of dry air
passing across a river, he found, as we might have
expected, to prevent the formation of mist even
when the temperature of the water was much
higher than that of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Thus did our philosopher, during the course of
his journey to Naples, by a series of observations
and experiments, investigate a phenomenon connected
with the deposition of water from the atmosphere,
and which is not without an effect in the
economy of nature; for verdure and fertility, in hot
climates, generally follow the courses of rivers, and
by the operation of the law he established, they are
extended to the hills, and even to the plains surrounding
their banks.</p>

<p>On his arrival at Naples, Sir H. Davy found that
a letter from his Royal Highness the Prince Regent
to the King, and a communication made from the
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Neapolitan
Government, had prepared the way for his
enquiries, and procured for him every possible facility
in the pursuit of his objects.</p>

<p>The different rolls of papyri presented very various
appearances. They were of all shades, from a light
chestnut brown to a deep black; some externally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
were of a glossy black, like jet, which the superintendents
called "varnished;" several contained the
umbilicus, or rolling-stick, in the middle, converted
into dense charcoal. In their texture, also, they
were as various as in their colours.</p>

<p>The persons to whom the care of these MSS. are
confided, or who have worked upon them, have
always attributed these different appearances to the
action of fire, more or less intense, according to the
proximity of the lava, which has been imagined to
have covered the part of the city in which they were
found; but the different conclusion at which Davy
had arrived, from a chemical examination in England,
was confirmed by a visit to the excavations
that still remained open at Herculaneum.</p>

<p>These excavations are in a loose <em>tufa</em>, composed
of sand, volcanic ashes, stones, and dust, cemented
by the operation of water, which, at the time of
its action, was probably in a boiling state. The
theatre, and the buildings in the neighbourhood,
are incased in this <em>tufa</em>, and, from the manner in
which it is deposited in the galleries of the houses,
there can be little doubt that it was the result of
torrents laden with sand and volcanic matter, and
descending, at the same time, with showers of ashes
and stone still more copious than those that covered
Pompeii. The excavation in the house in which
the MSS. were found, had been filled up; but a
building, which was said by the guides to be this
house, and which, as is evident from the engraved
plan, must at least have been close to it, at once
convinced Davy that the parts nearest the surface,
and, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à fortiori</i>, those more remote from it, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
never been exposed to any considerable degree of
heat. He found a small fragment of the ceiling of
one of the rooms, containing lines of gold leaf and
vermilion, in an unaltered state, which never could
have happened had they been acted upon by any
temperature sufficiently great to convert vegetable
matter into charcoal.</p>

<p>The different states of the MSS. exactly coincide
with this view, and furnish evidence of their having
undergone a gradual process of decomposition. The
loose chestnut papyri, he observes, were probably
never wetted, but merely changed by the reaction
of their elements, assisted by the operation of a
small quantity of air; the black ones, which easily
unroll, may be supposed to have remained in a
moist state, without any percolation of water; while
it is likely that the dense ones, containing earthy
matter, have been acted on by warm water, which
not only carried into the folds earthy matter suspended
in it, but likewise dissolved the starch and
gluten used in preparing the papyrus and the glue
of the ink, and distributed them through the substance
of the MSS.</p>

<p>As many of the papyri appear to have been
strongly compressed when moist, in different positions,
he thinks it probable that they had been
placed on shelves of wood, which were broken down
when the roofs of the houses yielded to the superincumbent
mass. That the operation of fire is not
at all necessary for producing such an imperfect
carbonization of vegetable matter as that displayed
by the MSS., is at once proved by an inspection
of the houses at Pompeii, which was covered by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
shower of ashes that must have been cold, as they
fell at the distance of seven or eight miles from the
crater of Vesuvius; and yet the wood of its buildings
is uniformly found converted into charcoal,
while the colours on the walls, most of which would
have been destroyed or altered by heat, are perfectly
fresh. Where papyri have been found in
these houses, they have appeared in the form of
white ashes, as of burnt paper, an effect produced
by the slow action of the air penetrating through
the loose ashes, and which has been impeded or
prevented in Herculaneum by the <em>tufa</em>, which, as
it were, hermetically sealed up the town, and prevented
any decay, except such as occurs in the
spontaneous decomposition of vegetable substances
exposed to the limited operation of water and air&mdash;for
instance, peat and Bovey coal.</p>

<p>Davy ascertained, that what the Neapolitans
called varnish, was decomposed skin that had been
used to infold some of the papyri, and which by
chemical changes had produced a brilliant animal
carbonaceous substance, which afforded by distillation
a considerable quantity of ammonia, and left
ashes containing much phosphate of lime.</p>

<p>Only one method, and that a simple and mechanical,
though a highly ingenious one, had been
adopted for unrolling the MSS. It was invented,
in the middle of the last century, by Padre Piaggi,
a Roman, and consists in attaching a thin animal
membrane, by a solution of glue, to the back of the
MSS. and then carefully elevating the layers by
silk threads, which are gradually moved by the revolution
of wooden pegs. Davy, shortly after his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
arrival, desired that the process of unrolling might
be continued in his presence; and in considering
the method in its general application, it occurred to
him that some expedient might be used to facilitate
the separation of the layers. For this purpose, he
proposed to mix the solution of glue with a sufficient
quantity of alcohol to gelatinize it, in order
that it might not penetrate through three or
four layers, which it was liable to do, when the
texture of the papyrus was loose or broken, and the
glue employed was in a liquid state. He also suggested
the application of warm air for drying the
papyrus, in the operation of attaching the membrane.
It is not my intention to follow the chemist
through all the various processes which he instituted
for accomplishing his object; they may, however,
be found in his paper entitled "Some Observations
and Experiments on the Papyri found in
the Ruins of Herculaneum," which was read before
the Royal Society on the 15th of March 1821, and
published in the Transactions of that year.</p>

<p>It only remains to be stated that Davy was not
successful; but though the process of unrolling
hitherto applied may not have received any considerable
improvement from his science, and though he
may not have succeeded in rendering any of the
manuscripts legible, the failure is not to be attributed
to his want of zeal, or to his want of skill, but
solely, as it is generally admitted, to the unfortunate
condition of the papyri.</p>

<p>It will be readily supposed that a failure in an investigation,
from which he had anticipated so much
advantage, was not sustained by a person naturally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
quick and irritable, without some demonstrations of
impatience and dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>It was probably under the influence of such feelings,
that he composed the conclusion of his memoir.
"During the two months that I was actively employed
in experiments on the papyri at Naples, I
had succeeded, with the assistance of six of the persons
attached to the Museum, and whom I had engaged
for the purpose, in partially unrolling twenty-three
MSS., from which fragments of writing
were obtained, and in examining about one hundred
and twenty others, which afforded no hopes of success;
and I should gladly have gone on with the
undertaking, from the mere prospect of a possibility
of discovering some better result, had not the labour,
in itself difficult and unpleasant, been made more so,
by the conduct of the persons at the head of this
department in the Museum. At first, every disposition
was shown to promote my researches; for the
papyri remaining unrolled were considered by them
as incapable of affording any thing legible by the
former methods, or, to use their own word, <i>disperati</i>;
and the efficacy and use of the new processes were
fully allowed by the <i>Svolgatori</i>, or unrollers of the
Museum; and I was some time permitted to choose
and operate upon the specimens at my own pleasure.
When, however, the Reverend Peter Elmsley,
whose zeal for the promotion of ancient literature
brought him to Naples for the purpose of assisting
in the undertaking, began to examine the fragments
unrolled, a jealousy with regard to his assistance was
immediately manifested; and obstacles, which the
kind interference of Sir William A'Court was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
always capable of removing, were soon opposed to
the progress of our enquiries; and these obstacles
were so multiplied, and made so vexatious towards
the end of February, that we conceived it would be
both a waste of the public money and a compromise
of our own characters to proceed."</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>While in Italy, Sir H. Davy visited the baths of
Lucca, and examined the waters which have given
to that place so much celebrity. The results of his
analysis formed the subject of a paper, which was
published in the Memoirs of the Royal Academy
of Sciences at Naples, of which Society he was a
member.</p>

<p>At the spot where the temperature of the water
was the highest, that is, in what are termed the
<i>Caldi</i>, or hot baths, a considerable quantity of a substance
is ejected, which produces a deposit of a
brownish-yellow colour. Having collected a quantity
of this deposit, he ascertained it to consist of
oxide of iron and silica, in the proportion of about
four parts of the former to three of the latter; and
although the iron, at the time of its deposition,
proved to be a <i>peroxide</i>, he thinks it probable that it
existed in the water in the state of <i>protoxide</i>. He
also supposes, that the oxide of iron and the silica
had been dissolved together in the water, and been
deposited from it in combination. He conceives that
the fact which he had some years before noticed, of
the analogy between the base of silica, and that of
boracic acid, together with those observed by Berzelius,
furnish sufficient reasons for classing silica
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
amongst the acids, and for rendering it probable,
that the oxide of iron and silica undergo a real
chemical combination in the warm water, and that
they are separated from the latter in consequence of
the reduction of its temperature, after it has issued
from the mountain.</p>

<p>A small portion of oxide of iron, he observes, is
found in the waters of Bath, in which case it is also
accompanied by silica; and he believes that, in many
other instances, the oxide of iron is dissolved in
water through the same agency: he moreover regards
such facts as throwing considerable light upon
the manner in which ochre is generated.</p>

<p>Sir Humphry Davy returned to England in 1820;
and, on the 19th of June, in the same year, his venerable
friend Sir Joseph Banks, who, notwithstanding
his increasing infirmities, had continued to discharge
the duties of President of the Royal Society
to the latest period of his life, expired at his villa at
Spring Grove, at the advanced age of seventy-seven.</p>

<p>Discussions necessarily arose as to the appointment
of a proper successor, when persons of high
and even exalted rank were proposed as candidates;
but the more influential members of the Society at
once found, in their own Council-chamber, two philosophers,
whom they considered equally entitled to
the honour of the situation, and equally well calculated
for the discharge of its duties&mdash;Sir Humphry
Davy, and Dr. Wollaston; but the latter having
signified his fixed determination to decline competition,
gave the whole weight of his influence to the
former; and, under that arrangement, he received
from the Council the compliment of being placed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
the chair, until the general election of officers at the
ensuing anniversary.</p>

<p>As the period of election approached, a few Fellows
of the Society attempted to raise a clamour in
favour of some more aristocratic candidate. To
this circumstance, Davy alludes in the following
letter.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO THOMAS POOLE, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">Grosvenor Street, June 1820.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR POOLE,</p>

<p>I regret very much that you could not join me
at dinner this day. To-morrow and the following
day I shall be occupied by pressing affairs; but
I shall be at home to-morrow till half-past eleven,
and be most happy to see you.</p>

<p>I am not very anxious to remove "mists," for
I feel that the President's chair, after Sir Joseph,
will be no light matter; and unless there is a strong
feeling in the majority of the body that I am the
most proper person, I shall not sacrifice my tranquillity
for what cannot add to my reputation,
though it may increase my power of being useful.</p>

<p>I feel it a duty that I owe to the Society to offer
myself; but if they do not feel that they want me,
(and the most active members, I believe, do) I shall
not force myself upon them.</p>

<p class="signature">I am, my dear Poole, very sincerely yours,<br />
<span class="smcap j10">H. Davy.</span></p>

</div>

<p>On the day of election, (November 30, 1820,)
there was a feeble expression in favour of Lord
Colchester, who was abroad at the time, and had
not even been made acquainted with the intention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
of his supporters. Davy was therefore elected by
an immense majority of votes. He was conducted
into the meeting-room by his two friends, Mr. Davies
Gilbert and Mr. Hatchett, and, to the gratification
of every lover of science, he ascended the chair
of Newton.</p>

<p>The value which he himself attached to this
triumph, may be seen in his answer to a letter of
congratulation from his friend Mr. Poole.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO THOMAS POOLE, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">Grosvenor Street, Dec. 10.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR POOLE,</p>

<p>I am much obliged to you for your congratulations.
The contest to my election defeated itself,
for there were only thirteen votes for Lord Colchester
out of nearly one hundred and sixty; and,
had it been known that the attempt would have
been made, I should have had at least double the
number. The overwhelming majority has, however,
shown the good opinion of the Society, which
I trust and feel has not been diminished by my
conduct in the chair.</p>

<p>I have never needed any motive to attach me to
science, which I have pursued with equal ardour
under all circumstances, for its own sake, and for
the sake of the public, uninfluenced by the fears of
my friends, or the calumnies of my enemies. I
glory in being in the chair of the Royal Society,
because I think it ought to be a reward of scientific
labours, and not an appendage to rank or fortune;
and because it will enable me to be useful in a
higher degree in promoting the cause of science.
To this cause, however, I should have been always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
attached, even had I not been in such good humour
with the public, as I have reason to be.</p>

<p>Dr. Wollaston, my only formidable opponent in
the beginning of the business, behaved like a true
philosopher and friend of science; and Mr. Gilbert
gave me his warmest support.</p>

<p>I am sorry that I have said so much about myself,
but your long letter called for something. I
wish I could say anything satisfactory on the subject
of Captain Parry and his officers.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> I have
every reason to believe Lord Melville will do all he
can on the occasion; no recommendation will be
wanting from the Royal Society that can be given;
but the Admiralty is bound by certain general rules,
and will not do more in this instance than they
would do in the case of a brilliant combat; but
these brave and scientific navigators will be rewarded
by a more durable species of glory.</p>

<p>Lady Davy joins me in kind remembrances.</p>

<p class="signature2">I am, my dear Poole, sincerely yours,<br />
<span class="smcap j10">H. Davy</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>It was a question anxiously discussed by the
friends of Davy, how far his elevation to the chair
of the Royal Society was calculated to advance the
cause of science, or to increase the lustre of his own
fame. It will be readily perceived that this is a
question perplexed by various conflicting interests,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
for it not only involves considerations relating to
the character of the person, but to that also of the
constitution and objects of the Society over which
he is called upon to preside.</p>

<p>It is still doubtful whether the Royal Society, in
the present advanced state of science, can derive advantage
from possessing in its President, a philosopher
actively engaged in any one branch of experimental
enquiry. Sir Humphry Davy, in his first
address from the chair, took occasion to observe,
that "in the early periods of the establishment,
when apparatus was procured with difficulty, when
the greatest philosophers were obliged to labour
with their own hands to frame their instruments, it
was found expedient to keep in the rooms of the
Society a collection of all such machines as were
likely to be useful in the progress of experimental
knowledge; and curators and operators were employed,
by whom many capital experiments were
made under the eyes of the Society.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> But since the
improvement of the mechanical and chemical arts
has afforded greater facilities as to the means of carrying
on experimental research, the transactions of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
the Fellows, recorded by the Society, have, with
some few exceptions, been performed in their own
laboratories, and at their own expense."</p>

<p>In deciding upon the qualifications necessary for
a President, this altered state of the Society must
not be overlooked; nor can it be concealed, that
the great discoveries of modern science have been
achieved without any direct assistance from the
Royal Society. Davy would have discovered the
laws of electro-chemistry, and applied them for the
decomposition of the alkalies&mdash;and the genius of
Dalton would, by his atomic doctrine, have "snatched
the science from the chaos of indefinite combination,
and have bound it in the chains of number,"
had the Society never existed. At the same time,
it must be allowed that, although it may not have
directly advanced the progress of science, it has
materially assisted its cause, by perpetuating the
spirit of philosophical enquiry, and the love of
scientific glory&mdash;by keeping alive upon the altar
the sacred flame that genius may have kindled.</p>

<p>In the present state of science, the Royal Society
imparts an inspiring principle to its various branches,
by affording a rallying point, a centre of communication,
to the philosophers of all nations, to whom
kindred pursuits may render personal intercourse
beneficial; and it becomes the paramount duty of
the chief of this great republic so to preside over its
arrangements, as to foster and encourage such an
alliance. To this end, he must promote feelings of
mutual kindness and liberality; and as the friend
and umpire to all parties, it is his office to settle
disagreement, to soothe disappointment, to kindle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
hope, and to subdue the vehemence which "engenders
strife," in order that rivalship shall not pass
into hostility, nor emulation degenerate into envy.
It is evident that the talents and qualifications necessary
for the discharge of such duties are of the
highest order, extensive in their range, and diversified
in their character. To which, however harshly
the word may grate upon the ear of the philosopher,
<span class="smcap">WEALTH</span> must be considered as an essential and
indispensable condition.</p>

<p>It may be fairly asked, whether a philosopher
actively engaged in the pursuit of any branch of
science, is so well adapted for the performance of
such varied duties, as the person who possesses a
general acquaintance with every department, but is
not exclusively devoted to the investigation of any
one branch; for, however correct may be his decisions,
or unbiassed his judgment, the conduct of the
former will ever be open to the charge of partiality,
and the bare existence of such a suspicion, though
it may be wholly groundless, will carry with it a
train of evils. It is not in human nature to believe
that the looker-on, and he who plays the game, are
alike indifferent to the cards.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, it may be urged with some
force, that the Presidency of the Royal Society
should be reserved as the fair reward of scientific
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
labours, and not as an appendage to rank or to
wealth:&mdash;that in England, we may in vain search
amongst the aristocracy for one who feels a dignified
respect for the sciences, and who is willing to afford
that time which the faithful discharge of its duties
would require.</p>

<p>To assert that Davy retained his popularity, or to
deny that he retired from the office under the frown
of a considerable party, would be dishonest. I
would willingly dismiss this part of his life without
too nice an examination; but I am writing a history,
not an eloge.</p>

<p>As a philosopher, his claims to admiration and
respect were allowed in all their latitude; but when
he sought for the homage due to patrician distinction,
they were denied with indignation. How
strange it is, that those whom Nature has placed
above their fellow men by the god-like gift of
genius, should seek from their inferiors those distinctions
which are generally the rewards of fortune.
When we learn that Congreve, in his interview
with Voltaire, prided himself upon his fashion rather
than upon his wit; that Byron was more vain
of his heraldry than of his "Pilgrimage of Childe
Harold;" that Racine pined into an atrophy, because
the monarch passed him without a recognition in
the ante-room of the palace, and that Davy sighed
for patrician distinction in the chair of Newton, we
can only lament the weakness from which the
choicest spirits of our nature are not exempt. Will
philosophers never feel, with Walpole, that "a genius
transmits more honour by blood than he can
receive?" Had the blood of forty generations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
nobility flowed in the veins of Davy, would his
name have commanded higher homage, or his discoveries
have excited greater admiration? But great
minds have ever had their points of weakness: an
inordinate admiration of hereditary rank was the
cardinal deformity of Davy's character; it was the
centre from which all his defects radiated, and continually
placed him in false positions; for the man
who rests his claims upon doubtful or ill-defined
pretensions, from a sense of his insecurity, naturally
becomes jealous at every apparent inattention, and
he is suspicious of the sincerity of that respect
which he feels may be the fruit of usurpation. If
with these circumstances we take into consideration
the existence of a natural timidity of character,
which he sought to conquer by efforts that betrayed
him into awkwardness of manner, and combine
with it an irritability of temperament which
occasionally called up expressions of ill-humour, we
at once possess a clue by which we may unravel
the conduct of our philosopher, and the consequences
it brought upon himself during his presidency
of the Royal Society. Nor must we leave
out of sight that inattention to certain forms which,
amongst those who are incapable of penetrating
beyond the surface of character, passes for the offensive
carelessness of superiority. Davy, after the
example of Sir Joseph Banks, opened his house on
one evening of the week for the reception of the
Fellows of the Royal Society, and of other persons
who were actively engaged in any scientific
pursuit; but the invitations to these <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soirées</i> were
so irregularly managed, that they frequently gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
offence, where they were intended to convey a compliment.</p>

<p>Conflicting opinions, respecting the management
of the Royal Institution, most unfortunately also
arose, and the President of the Royal Society,
presuming upon his former alliance with that establishment,
and upon the high obligations conferred
upon it by the splendid discoveries he had
achieved within its walls, was encouraged to exercise
an authority which provoked an angry dissatisfaction;&mdash;schisms
arose, and the party-spirit
thus kindled in Albemarle Street soon spread to
Somerset House.&mdash;But let us turn to the brighter
part of the picture. In the discharge of the more
important duties of his office, the Society received
the full benefit of his talents and his virtues. At
its meetings, he was constant in attendance, and
dignified in his conduct and deportment; in its
councils, he was firm in his resolves, correct in his
judgments, zealous in his plans,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> and impartial in
his decisions. It has been said that he unduly favoured
the pursuits of chemistry, to the injury and
depression of the other branches of science: this is
not the fact, as a reference to the Philosophical
Transactions will amply testify; and the awards
of the Copley medals will moreover show, that he
alike extended the animating influence of his patronage
to every part of natural philosophy. I am
authorised by Sir James South to state, that during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
his negotiations with the Government, for the purpose
of securing to the British Nation the unalienable
use of his splendid instruments, by the erection
of a permanent observatory, Sir Humphry Davy
was indefatigable in his exertions to accomplish so
important an object; and that on one occasion, in
the midst of severe illness, he travelled at no inconsiderable
risk to London, from the distant seat
of his friend Mr. Knight, to advocate a cause so
essential, in his judgment, to the interests of Astronomy.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>In the Autumn of 1821, Davy visited his mother
and relatives at Penzance; upon which occasion he
received from the inhabitants of the town, and from
the gentlemen resident in its neighbourhood, a flattering
testimony of respect, which made a deep and
lasting impression upon his heart.</p>

<p>At a General Meeting, summoned for the purpose
of taking into consideration some mode by which his
fellow-townsmen might express their sense of his
transcendent talents, and of the lustre which his
genius had cast upon the place of his nativity:&mdash;It
was unanimously <span class="smcap">RESOLVED</span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"That a public dinner be given to Sir Humphry
Davy, and that the Mayor be desired to wait upon
him forthwith, in order to communicate the Resolution,
and respectfully to request that he would appoint
the day, on which it would be agreeable to
him to meet their wishes."</p>

<p>On the day appointed, a deputation of Gentlemen
proceeded in their carriages to the house of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
mother, for the purpose of conducting him to the
hotel, where an appropriate entertainment had been
provided for the occasion.</p>

<p>The following letter evinces the sincere satisfaction
which this visit afforded him.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<hr class="c15" />

<p>Many years before even the identity of lightning
and electricity was suspected, it had been observed,
on several occasions, that the magnetism of the compass
needle was not only destroyed, which might
have been attributed to heat, but that it was even reversed
by lightning.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
In the progress of electrical discoveries, the similarity
between electricity and magnetism had not
escaped observation,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and some philosophers had
even attempted to establish the existence of an identity
or intimate relation between these two forces.
The experiments of Ritter, however, alone appeared
to offer any confirmation of the supposed analogy;
but so obscure was his language, and so wild and
hypothetical his views, that few, if any, of them
were repeated either in France or England, and
their results were for a long time wholly disregarded.</p>

<p>In a work, entitled "Recherches sur l'identité des
Forces Chimiques et Electriques," published by M.
Oersted in the year 1807, the subject was resumed,
and the author advanced the hypothesis,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
twelve years afterwards conducted him to one of
the most important discoveries of the present age,
and which has given origin to a new science, termed
<span class="smcap">Electro-magnetism</span>.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>In the winter of 1819, Professor Oersted, Secretary
to the Royal Society of Copenhagen, published
an account of some experiments, in which the electric
current, such as is supposed to pass from the
positive to the negative pole of a Voltaic battery,
along a wire which connects them, caused a magnetic
needle near it to deviate from its natural
position, and to assume a new one, the direction of
which was observed to depend upon the relative
position of the needle and the wire.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>It may be necessary to premise, that these experiments
were conducted in a form which had never
before suggested itself to the enquirer; <em>viz. with
the two ends of the pile in communication with each
other</em>,&mdash;a condition which enabled it to discharge
itself freely: this circumstance will, at once, explain
the reason of all preceding failures. It was
never before suspected that the electric current,
passing <em>uninterruptedly</em> through a wire, connecting
the two ends of a Voltaic battery, was capable of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
being manifested by any effect; the experiments,
however, in question furnished an unequivocal test
of its passage by its action on the magnetic needle;
and which may be shortly stated as follows:</p>

<p>The opposite poles of a battery, in full action,
were joined by a metallic wire, which, to avoid circumlocution,
has been called the <em>uniting conductor</em>,
or the <em>uniting wire</em>.</p>

<p>On placing the wire above the magnet and parallel
to it, the pole next the negative end of the
battery always moved westward, and when the wire
was placed under the needle, the same pole went
towards the east. If the wire was on the same horizontal
plane with the needle, no declination whatever
took place, but the magnet showed a disposition
to move in a vertical direction; the pole next
the negative side of the battery being depressed
when the wire was to the west of it, and elevated
when it was placed on the east side.</p>

<p>The extent of the declination occasioned by a
battery, depends upon its power, and the distance
of the uniting wire from the needle. If the apparatus
is powerful, and the distance small, the declination
will amount to an angle of forty-five degrees
or more; but this deviation does not give an exact
idea of the real effect which may be produced by
galvanism; for the motion of the needle is counteracted
by the magnetism of the Earth. When
the influence of this latter power is destroyed by
means of another magnet, the needle will place itself
directly across the connecting wire: so that the
real tendency of a magnet is to stand at right angles
to an electric current. Such phenomena, being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
wholly at variance with the laws of simple electrical
attraction and repulsion, are only to be explained
upon the supposition that a new energy is generated
by the action of the current of electricity thus
brought into conflict, and which must be identical
with, or nearly related to, magnetism.</p>

<p>It would also appear from the motions of the
magnet, when differently placed with regard to the
<em>uniting wire</em>, that this energy circulates, or performs
a circular movement around the axis of the conductor,
and thus drives the magnetic pole according
to the direction of the needle with reference to such
a current.</p>

<p>This important discovery was no sooner announced
to the philosophical world, than Sir Humphry
Davy, with his characteristic zeal, proceeded
to repeat the experiments; and, with his usual sagacity,
so to vary and extend them, as to throw
new light upon this novel department of science.
The facts he thus discovered, and the reasonings
founded upon them, were communicated by him to
the Royal Society in three successive memoirs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The First</span>, "On the Magnetic Phenomena produced
by Electricity," was read on the 16th of November
1820.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Second</span>, entitled "Farther Researches on
the Magnetic Phenomena produced by Electricity;
with some new Experiments on the properties of
Electrified bodies, in their relations to conducting
powers and Temperature," read July 5th, 1821.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Third</span>, "On a new Phenomenon of Electro-magnetism,"
read March 6th, 1823.</p>

<p>The principal experiments communicated in these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
memoirs were performed with the battery belonging
to the London Institution,<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> the once powerful
apparatus at the Royal Institution having become
old and feeble in his service.</p>

<p>The following letter contains an invitation to his
friend Mr. Pepys, to witness his first experiment; a
document so far valuable, as it fixes a date of some
importance in the history of discovery.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO WILLIAM HASLEDINE PEPYS, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">Grosvenor Street, Oct. 20, 1820.</p>

<p class="opening">DEAR PEPYS,</p>

<p>The experiment I wish to show you is no less
than the conversion of electricity into magnetism;
but it is a secret as yet.</p>

<p>I will come to you at twelve on Monday, in the

battery to be charged to-morrow, it will be ready
for us on Monday.</p>

<p>Have you a dipping needle? This, and an air-pump,
and the globe for taking sparks <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in vacuo</i> by
points of charcoal, are all we shall want.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will invite Dr. Babington, and our
worthy friend Allen.</p>

<p>I will show you the opening of quite a new field
of experiment. Ever yours very sincerely,</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">H. Davy</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>The discovery of Professor Oersted was limited
to the action of the electric current on needles previously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
magnetised. Davy ascertained that the
<em>uniting conductor itself became magnetic</em>, during the
passage of the electricity through it.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> It was in
consequence of having observed some anomaly, with
respect to the way in which the uniting wire altered
the direction of the magnet, that he was led
to a conjecture which he immediately verified by
a very simple experiment. He threw some iron
filings on a paper, and brought them near the uniting
wire, when immediately they were attracted by
the wire, and adhered to it in considerable quantities,
forming a mass round it ten or twelve times
the thickness of the wire: on breaking the communication,
they instantly fell off, proving that the
magnetic effect entirely depended upon the passage
of electricity through the wire.</p>

<p>Davy observes, it was easy to imagine that such
magnetic effects could not be exhibited by the electrical
wire, without its being capable of permanently
communicating them to steel; and that, in order to
ascertain whether such was the fact, he fastened
several steel needles, in different directions, to the
uniting wire, when those parallel to it were found
to act like the wire itself, while each of those placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
across it acquired two poles. Such as were placed
<em>under</em> the wire, the positive end of the battery being
east, had north poles on the south of the wire, and
south poles to the north. The needles <em>above</em> were
in the opposite direction; and this was constantly
the case, whatever might be the inclination of the
needle to the wire. On breaking the connexion,
the steel needles, placed <em>across</em> the uniting wire,
retained their magnetism,<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> while those placed <em>parallel</em>
to it lost it at the moment of disunion. The
most extraordinary circumstances, however, connected
with these experiments were, first, that <em>contact</em>
with the uniting wire was not found necessary
for the production of the effect,&mdash;indeed, it was
even produced, though thick glass intervened; and,
secondly, that a needle which had been placed in a
transverse direction to the wire, merely for an instant,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
was found as powerful a magnet as one that
had been long in communication with it.</p>

<p>The distance to which magnetism is communicated
by electricity, and the fact of its taking place
equally through conductors and non-conductors, are
circumstances which, in the opinion of Davy, are
unfavourable to the idea of the identity of electricity
and magnetism.</p>

<p>Davy subsequently ascertained by experiment,
that the magnetic result was proportional to the
quantity of electricity passing through a given
space; and this fact led him to believe, that a wire
electrified by the common machine would not occasion
a sensible effect; and this he found to be the
case, on placing very small needles across a fine wire
connected with a prime conductor of a powerful
machine and the earth. But as a momentary exposure
in a powerful electrical circuit was sufficient
to give permanent polarity to steel, it appeared
equally obvious, that needles placed transversely to
a wire at the time that the electricity of a common
Leyden battery was discharged through it, ought
to become magnetic; and this he found was actually
the fact, and according to precisely the same
laws as in the Voltaic circuit; the needle <em>under</em> the
wire, the positive conductor being on the right
hand, offering its north pole to the face of the
operator, and the needle <em>above</em>, exhibiting the opposite
polarity.</p>

<p>The facility with which experiments are made
with the common Leyden battery, enabled him to
ascertain various other important facts, respecting
the communication of magnetism, which it would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
be inconsistent with the nature and limits of this
work to particularize. I have merely offered a notice
of the more prominent discoveries communicated
by him in his first paper to the Royal Society,
and which he concludes by observing, that "in consequence
of the facts lately developed, a number of
curious speculations cannot fail to present themselves
to every philosophical mind; such as whether
the magnetism of the earth may not be owing
to its electricity, and the variation of the needle to
the alterations in the electrical currents of the earth,
in consequence of its motions, internal changes, or
its relations to solar heat; and whether the luminous
effects of the auroras at the poles are not
shown, by these new facts, to depend on electricity.
This is evident, that if strong electrical currents be
supposed to follow the apparent course of the sun,
the magnetism of the earth ought to be such as it is
found to be."<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Davy never overlooked an occasion of applying
theory to practice, and he therefore proposes, upon
the principles developed in this paper, to make
powerful magnets, by fixing bars of steel, or circular
pieces of steel, fitted for making horse-shoe
magnets, round the electrical conductors of buildings
in elevated and exposed situations.</p>

<p>His second paper contains an account of experiments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
instituted with a view to gain some distinct
knowledge on the subject of the relations of the
different conductors to the magnetism produced by
electricity. The results were decisive; but, without
entering minutely into the theory of the subject
which they so ably illustrated, these experiments
cannot be clearly described, or successfully
explained. The same observation will apply to the
researches detailed in his third paper, announcing
the discovery of a <em>new electro-magnetic phenomenon</em>;
for, since they are inseparably connected with Mr.
Faraday's beautiful experiments on <em>Magnetic Rotation</em>,
I could scarcely expect to render my analysis
of the memoir sufficiently intelligible, without entering
at length upon that curious subject; I am
unwilling, however, to refer the reader to the original
paper in the Transactions, without offering a
remark upon the <em>phenomenon</em>, which he says "is the
<em>principal</em> object of the paper," but which we might
conclude, from the hasty and imperfect manner in
which he dismisses it, to have occupied a very subordinate
place in his estimation. In his anxiety to
examine and describe the rotations produced during
this experiment, he bestows far too little attention
upon the more, indeed I might say the <em>only</em>, important
phenomenon of the cone of mercury which
was elevated above each of the wires proceeding
from the battery; and which, arising as it evidently
did from a repulsive influence, clearly shows that
the presence of electricity establishes between the
particles of matter a repulsive energy, whether that
matter be conducting, or non-conducting in its
functions. This law, M. Ampère subsequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
illustrated by a different form of experiment, and
unfairly, as I must think, omitted even to notice
Davy's prior result.</p>

<p>On the 20th of December 1821, Davy communicated
to the Royal Society a memoir "On the
Electrical Phenomena exhibited <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in vacuo</i>."</p>

<p>It had been stated by Mr. Walsh, and the opinion
had been subsequently supported by the researches
of Mr. Morgan, that the electrical light was not
producible in a perfect Torricellian vacuum; the
latter gentleman also concluded that such a vacuum
prevented the charging of coated glass.</p>

<p>An enquiry of greater importance can scarcely be
imagined; involving in its train several of the most
abstruse and difficult questions of corpuscular philosophy;
as, whether electricity be a subtile fluid,
or electrical effect the mere exhibition of the attractive
powers of the particles of bodies; for, if it
can be shown that these effects take place in a perfect
vacuum, we shall advance towards the conclusion,
that electrical phenomena depend upon the
agency of an ethereal and transcendental fluid. It
was under such an impression that Davy proceeded
to determine, if possible, "the relations of electricity
to space, as nearly void of matter as it can be made
on the surface of the earth."</p>

<p>He was, in the first instance, led to suspect the
accuracy of those conclusions at which Mr. Walsh
and Mr. Morgan had arrived, from considering
that, "in the most perfect vacuum which can be
obtained in the Torricellian tube, vapour of mercury,
though of extremely small density, must still
always exist." I propose to follow our philosopher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
through the paths of this enquiry; and then, with
all the deference due to such high authority, to
state the objections which may be urged against his
results.</p>

<p>First, then, as to the results he obtained with
quicksilver in an apparatus simple, but well adapted
at once to insure the most completely attainable
vacuum, and to exhibit its capability of receiving
a charge. In all cases where this vacuum was perfect,
he found it to be permeable to electricity, and
to be rendered luminous, either by the common
spark, or by the shock from a Leyden jar; and,
moreover, that the coated glass surrounding it became
charged under such circumstances; but the
intensity of the light in these experiments was
always in proportion to the temperature, or, in other
words, to the density of the mercurial vapour; and
that at 20° below zero of Fahrenheit, it became so
faint as to require considerable darkness to render it
perceptible.</p>

<p>The great brilliancy, on the other hand, of the
electrical light in pure, dense vapour of mercury,
was beautifully displayed during the operation of
boiling the metal in an exhausted tube. "In the
formation and condensation of the globules of mercurial
vapour, the electricity produced by the friction
of the mercury against the glass, was discharged
through the vapour with sparks so bright as to be
visible in daylight."</p>

<p>The charge likewise communicated to the tinfoil
was higher, the higher the temperature; at 0°
Fahrenheit it was extremely feeble. This, like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
phenomenon of the electric light, must, he thinks,
depend upon the different density of the vapour of
mercury.</p>

<p>But he was desirous of still farther refining his
experiments, so as to exclude, as far as it was possible,
the presence of any volatile matter; and in
this part of the enquiry he displayed, in a very
masterly manner, that happy talent in which he so
far surpassed his contemporaries, of suggesting expedients
and contriving new apparatus in order to
vanquish practical difficulties.</p>

<p>To get rid of a portion of mercurial vapour, he
employed a difficultly fusible amalgam of mercury
and tin, which was made to crystallize by cooling in
the tube; but, in this case, the results were precisely
the same as when pure mercury had been
used. He then attempted to make a vacuum above
the fusible alloy of bismuth, but he found it so
liable to oxidate and soil the tube, that he soon renounced
farther attempts of this kind. Nothing
discouraged, he determined to try the effects of a
comparatively fixed metal in fusion. By melting
freshly cut pieces of grain tin, in a tube made void
after having been filled with hydrogen, and by
long-continued heat and agitation, he obtained a
column of fixed metal which appeared to be entirely
free from gas; and yet the vacuum made above
this exhibited the same phenomena as the mercurial
vacuum, except that they were not perceptibly increased
by heat: a fact which Davy must have
anticipated, as he attributed the greater display of
electrical light, at high temperatures, to the effect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
of increased density of vapour; it is therefore a
matter of surprise that he did not give more importance
to the phenomenon.</p>

<p>He made two experiments on electrical and magnetic
repulsions and attractions in the mercurial
vacuum, and he found that two balls, the one of
platinum, the other of steel, properly arranged for
the purpose, repelled each other, when the conducting
wire to which they were attached was electrified
in the most perfect mercurial vacuum, as they would
have done in the usual cases: and that the steel
globules were as obedient to the magnet as in the
air; which last result, he observes, it was easy to
have anticipated.</p>

<p>He also made some comparative experiments,
with the view of ascertaining, whether below the
freezing point of water the diminution of the temperature
of the Torricellian vacuum diminished its
power of transmitting electricity, or of being rendered
luminous by it. To about twenty degrees,
this appeared to be the case; but between twenty
degrees above, and twenty degrees below zero, the
lowest temperature he could produce by pounded
ice and muriate of lime, it seemed stationary; and,
as well as he could determine, the electrical phenomena
were very nearly of the same intensity as
those produced in the vacuum above tin.</p>

<p>"It is evident," he says, "from these general results,
that the light (and probably the heat) generated
in electrical discharges depends <em>principally</em> on
some properties or substances belonging to the ponderable
matter through which it passes: but they
prove likewise that space, where there is no appreciable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
quantity of this matter, is still capable of
exhibiting electric phenomena&mdash;viz. those of attraction
and repulsion, &amp;c.: a fact unquestionably
favourable to the idea of the phenomena of electricity
being produced by a highly subtile fluid or
fluids, of which the particles are repulsive with respect
to each other, and attractive of the particles of
other matter."</p>

<p>However much we may admire the experimental
address displayed in this paper, we must confess that
its results are very far from being satisfactory. His
having assumed, without proof, and even without
examination, the theory that a perfect vacuum cannot
be produced in the Torricellian tube, and made
it the foundation of his reasonings, appears to me to
have vitiated all his conclusions. Mr. Faraday has
rendered it extremely probable, that a <em>limit</em> does actually
exist to the production of vapour by bodies
placed <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in vacuo</i>,<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> beneath which they are perfectly
fixed; and if this be true, it is evident that, at low
temperatures, a perfect vacuum may be produced in
the Torricellian tube; and it is highly probable that
Davy did thus actually produce one in several of his
experiments; especially in those where he found that,
by a farther reduction of temperature, no farther diminution
of electrical effect was perceptible: he had
in fact arrived at this limit to vaporization, and therefore
a farther reduction of temperature could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
possibly influence the phenomena. In this point of
view, the electrical light would seem to be <em>primary</em>,
or independent of foreign matter.&mdash;But though the
premises be granted, let the reader pause before he
hastens to any conclusion; for the cloud of mystery
has not been dissipated, it has only changed its place.
At the termination of his paper, Davy indulges in a
conjecture subversive of every conclusion deduced
from experiments <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in vacuo</i>. "When the intense
heat," says he, "produced by electricity, and the
strong attractive powers of differently electrified surfaces,
and the rapidity of the changes of state, are
considered, it does not seem at all improbable, that
the superficial particles of bodies, which, when detached
by the repulsive power of heat, form vapour,
may be likewise detached by electrical powers, and
that they may produce luminous appearances in a
vacuum free from all other matter, by the annihilation
of their opposite electrical states."</p>

<p>During the course of the enquiry, Davy is led to
suppose that air may exist in mercury, in the same
invisible state as it does in water, that is, distributed
through its pores; and that absorption of air
may, therefore, explain the difference of the heights
of the mercury in different barometers. This, it
must be confessed, if true, is a most disheartening
fact, as it at once precludes the possibility of any
thing like accuracy in our barometers; but Mr.
Daniell, to whom on all subjects of meteorology we
are bound to pay the greatest deference, differs altogether
from our philosopher upon this point, and he
adduces a single observation which he thinks nearly
disproves the supposition. "All fluids," says he,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
"which are known to absorb air into their pores, invariably
emit it when the pressure of the atmosphere
is removed; but, upon an extensive examination
of large bodies of mercury, variously heated in the
vacuum of an air-pump, I never saw a bubble of air
given off from the surface of the metal." Davy, it
must be stated, obtained a far different result; but
an observation of Mr. Daniell explains the cause of
it. "Air," he continues, "will rise from the contact
of the mercury with the glass in which it is contained,
in exact inverse proportion to the care with
which it has been filled, but it <em>never rises from the
surface of the mercury alone</em>. The difficulty of properly
filling a barometer tube, I attribute to the
attraction between the glass and the air&mdash;not to that
between the mercury and the air."<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>On the 13th of June 1822, a memoir was read
before the Royal Society, "On the state of Water
and Aëriform matter in cavities found in certain
Crystals. By Sir Humphry Davy, Bart. P.R.S."</p>

<p>It is generally admitted by Geologists, that the
greater number of the crystalline substances of the
mineral kingdom must have been previously in a
liquid state; but different schools have assumed different
causes for their solution; some attributing the
effect principally to the agency of water, others to
that of heat.</p>

<p>In the paper under consideration, the author very
freely avows himself as the champion of the latter
doctrine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
"When it is considered," says he, "that the solvent
power of water depends upon its temperature,
and its deposition of solid matters upon its change
of state or of temperature, and that, being a gravitating
substance, the same quantity must always belong
to the globe, it becomes difficult to allow much
weight to the arguments of the Wernerians, or Neptunists,
who have generally neglected, in their speculations,
the laws of chemical attraction.</p>

<p>"There are many circumstances, on the contrary,
favourable to that part of the views of the Huttonians,
or Plutonists, relating to the cause of crystallization;
such as the form of the earth, that of an
oblate spheroid flattened at the poles; the facility
with which heat, being a radiating substance, may
be lost and dissipated in free space; and the observations
which seem to show the present existence
of a high temperature in the interior of the globe."</p>

<p>He had often, he tells us, in the course of his
chemical researches, looked for facts, or experiments,
which might throw some light on this interesting
subject, but without success, till it occurred to him,
as he was considering the state of the fluid and
aëriform matters which are found included in certain
crystals, that these curious phenomena might be
examined in a manner to afford some important arguments
as to the formation of the crystal itself.</p>

<p>Having obtained, through the liberality of his
friends, a variety of appropriate specimens of rock-crystal,
he proceeded to submit them to experiment.
Their cavities were opened by means of diamond
drills, under either distilled water, oil, or mercury;
the gas was then expelled from them by the introduction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
of slender wires, and the included fluids
were drawn out by the aid of fine capillary tubes.</p>

<p>As soon as an opening was effected, the fluid
under which the operation had been performed
rushed into the cavity, and the globule of elastic
fluid contracted so as to appear from six to ten times
less than before the experiment. The fluid was
found to be nearly pure water,&mdash;the gas appeared to
be azote.</p>

<p>It was an interesting point to ascertain whether
the same circumstances occurred in productions found
in rocks which have been generally considered as
of igneous origin, such as the basaltic rocks in the
neighbourhood of Vicenza, the chalcedonies of which
so often afford water. On examining such specimens,
when, to obviate the possibility of any fallacy,
they were previously ascertained to be impermeable
to the atmosphere, analogous results were obtained:
water, containing very minute quantities of saline
impregnations, was found to be the fluid, and the
gas, as in the former instances, was ascertained to be
azote; but it was in a much more rarefied state than
in the rock-crystals, being between sixty and seventy
times as rare as atmospheric air.</p>

<p>The fact of azote being found in these cavities, he
explains, by supposing that atmospheric air might
have been originally included in the crystals, and
that the oxygen had been separated from it by the
attraction of the water; a conjecture which a direct
experiment appeared to confirm.</p>

<p>In reasoning upon the vacuum, or rarefied state
of the aëriform matter in the cavities of rock-crystals
and chalcedonies, he very justly states, that the phenomenon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
cannot be easily accounted for, except on
the supposition of their having been formed at a
higher temperature than that now belonging to the
surface of the globe: and he thinks it most probable
that the water and the silica were in chemical union,
and separated from each other by cooling, since
there are strong grounds for believing that a liquid
<em>hydrate of silica</em> would exist at high temperatures
under pressure, and that, like all liquid bodies in the
atmosphere, it would contain small quantities of
atmospheric air. If this be granted, we may readily
explain the phenomena presented by the gaseous
and liquid matters in rock-crystal and chalcedony.</p>

<p>Thus then did Davy assail the Neptunists in their
own camp, and vanquish them with their own
weapons; for the fact, which had been confidently
considered by the disciples of Werner, as, above all
others, hostile to the idea of the igneous origin of
crystalline rocks, namely, the existence of water in
them, has been made to afford a decisive argument
in favour of the very opinion it had been brought
forward to oppose.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>In an appendix to the foregoing paper, the examination
of two other crystals is detailed; the results
afforded were very different from those of the preceding
ones, but not less favourable to the theory of
igneous origin. One of these crystals was found to
contain a bituminous fluid; on piercing it under distilled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
water, the water rushed in, and entirely filled
the cavity, so that no aëriform matter but the vapour
of the substance could have been present. The fact
of almost a perfect vacuum existing in a cavity containing
an expansible but difficultly volatile substance,
must be considered as highly favourable to
the theory of the igneous origin of crystals.</p>

<p>In the other crystal, the quantity of aëriform
matter was unusually small in proportion to the
quantity of fluid, and from the peculiarity of its
motion, it appeared to be more likely to be compressed
than rarefied elastic fluid; and in piercing
the sides of the cavities, Davy found that this was
the case; it enlarged in volume from ten to twelve
times; the fluid was water, but the gas was too
minute in quantity to be examined. There is but
one mode of accounting for this phenomenon. The
crystal must have been formed under an immense
weight of atmosphere or fluid, sufficient to produce
a compression much more than adequate to compensate
for the expansive effects of heat.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>Every incident, however trifling, if it relates to
a great scientific discovery, merits the attention of
the historian. As it accidentally occurred to me,
and to me alone, to witness the original experiment
by which Mr. Faraday first condensed chlorine gas
into a liquid, I shall here state the circumstances
under which its liquefaction was effected.</p>

<p>I had been invited to dine with Sir Humphry
Davy, on Wednesday the 5th of March 1823, for
the purpose of meeting the Reverend Uriah Tonkin,
the heir of his early friend and benefactor of
that name.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> On quitting my house for that purpose,
I perceived that I had time to spare, and I
accordingly called in my way at the Royal Institution.
Upon descending into the laboratory, I
found Mr. Faraday engaged in experiments on
chlorine and its hydrate in closed tubes. It appeared
to me that the tube in which he was operating
upon this substance contained some oily matter,
and I rallied him upon the carelessness of employing
soiled vessels. Mr. Faraday, upon inspecting the
tube, acknowledged the justness of my remark, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
expressed his surprise at the circumstance. In consequence
of which, he immediately proceeded to file
off the sealed end; when, to our great astonishment,
the contents suddenly exploded, and the oily matter
vanished!</p>

<p>Mr. Faraday was completely at a loss to explain
the occurrence, and proceeded to repeat the experiment
with a view to its elucidation. I was unable,
however, to remain and witness the result.</p>

<p>Upon mentioning the circumstance to Sir Humphry
Davy after dinner, he appeared much surprised;
and after a few moments of apparent abstraction,
he said, "I shall enquire about this experiment
to-morrow."</p>

<p>Early on the next morning, I received from Mr.
Faraday the following laconic note:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="opening"><span class="smcap">DEAR SIR</span>,</p>

<p>The <em>oil</em> you noticed yesterday turns out to be
liquid chlorine.</p>

<p class="signature">Yours faithfully,<br />
<span class="smcap j4">M. Faraday</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>It is well known that, before the year 1810, the
solid substance obtained by exposing chlorine, as
usually procured, to a low temperature, was considered
as the gas itself reduced into that form: Sir
Humphry Davy, however, corrected this error, and
first showed it to be a hydrate, the pure gas not
being condensable even at a temperature of-40°
Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Mr. Faraday had taken advantage of the cold
season to procure crystals of this hydrate, and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
proceeding in its analysis,<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> when Sir Humphry
Davy suggested to him the expediency of observing
what would happen if it were heated in a close
vessel; but this suggestion was made in consequence
of the inspection of results already obtained
by Mr. Faraday, and which must have led him to
the experiment in question, had he never communicated
with Sir Humphry Davy upon the subject.
This avowal is honestly due to Mr. Faraday.</p>

<p>On exposing the hydrate, in a tube hermetically
sealed, to a temperature of 100°, the substance fused,
the tube became filled with a bright yellow atmosphere,
and, on examination, was found to contain
two fluid substances: the one, about three-fourths
of the whole, was of a faint yellow colour, having
very much the appearance of water; the remaining
fourth was a heavy, bright yellow fluid, lying at the
bottom of the former, without any apparent tendency
to mix with it.</p>

<p>By operating on the hydrate in a bent tube hermetically
sealed, Mr. Faraday found it easy, after
decomposing it by a heat of 100°, to distil the yellow
fluid to one end of the tube, and thus to separate
it from the remaining portion. If the tube
were now cut in the middle, the parts flew asunder,
as if with an explosion, the whole of the yellow
portion disappeared, and there was a powerful atmosphere
of chlorine produced; the pale portion,
on the contrary, remained, and when examined,
proved to be a weak solution of chlorine in water,
with a little muriatic acid, probably from the impurity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
of the hydrate used. When that end of the
tube in which the yellow fluid lay was broken
under a jar of water, there was an immediate production
of chlorine gas.</p>

<p>After several conjectures as to the nature of the
changes thus produced, Mr. Faraday arrived at its
true explanation; viz. that the chlorine had been
entirely separated from the water by the heat, and
condensed into a dry fluid by the mere pressure of its
own abundant vapour. He subsequently confirmed
these views by condensing chlorine in a long tube,
by mechanical pressure, applied by means of a condensing
syringe, and which farther enabled him to
ascertain that the degree of pressure necessary for
this effect was about that of four atmospheres.</p>

<p>To Mr. Faraday's paper upon this subject, published
in the Philosophical Transactions for the year
1823, Sir Humphry Davy thought proper to add a
"Note on the condensation of muriatic acid gas
into the liquid form."</p>

<p>The circumstances under which this was effected
are briefly these. On the morning (Thursday,
March 6th,) after Mr. Faraday had condensed chlorine,
Sir Humphry Davy had no sooner witnessed
the result, than he called for a strong glass tube,
and, having placed in it a quantity of muriate of
ammonia and sulphuric acid, and then sealed the
end, he caused them to act upon each other, and
thus condensed the muriatic acid, which was evolved,
into a liquid. The condensation of carbonic acid
gas, nitrous oxide gas, and several others, were in
succession treated with similar success; but, as I
regard the discovery as strictly belonging to Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
Faraday, I shall confine myself to the relation of
those experiments and deductions which, with equal
justice, I must assign to Sir Humphry Davy.</p>

<p>He observes, "that the generation of elastic substances
in close vessels, either with or without heat,
offers much more powerful means of approximating
their molecules than those dependent upon the
application of cold, whether natural or artificial:
for, as gases diminish only about 1/450 in volume for
every&mdash;degree of Fahrenheit's scale, beginning at
ordinary temperatures, a very slight condensation
only can be produced by the most powerful freezing
mixtures, not half as much as would result from
the application of a strong flame to one part of a
glass tube, the other part being of ordinary temperature:
and when attempts are made to condense
gases into liquids by sudden mechanical compression,
the heat, instantly generated, presents a formidable
obstacle to the success of the experiment;
whereas, in the compression resulting from their
slow generation in close vessels, if the process be
conducted with common precautions, there is no
source of difficulty or danger; and it may be easily
assisted by artificial cold in cases when gases approach
near to that point of compression and temperature
at which they become vapours."</p>

<p>On the 17th of April 1823, he communicated to
the Royal Society a paper "On the application of
Liquids formed by the condensation of Gases as
mechanical agents."</p>

<p>He states that doubts may, for various philosophical
reasons, exist as to the economical results
to be obtained by employing the steam of water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
under great pressures, and at very elevated temperatures;
but that no doubts can arise with respect
to the use of such liquids as require for their
existence even a compression equal to that of the
weight of thirty or forty atmospheres; and where
common temperatures, or slight elevations of them,
are sufficient to produce an immense elastic force;
and when the principal question to be discussed is,
whether the effect of mechanical motion is to be most
easily produced by an increase or diminution of
heat by artificial means.</p>

<p>With the assistance of Mr. Faraday, he made
several experiments on the differences between the
increase of elastic force in gases under high and
low pressures, by similar increments of temperature.
In an experiment made with carbonic acid,
its force was found to be nearly equal to that of air
compressed to one-twentieth at 12° Fah. and of air
compressed to one-thirty-sixth at 32 degrees, making
an increase equal to the weight of thirteen atmospheres
by an increase of twenty of temperature!</p>

<p>In applying, however, the condensed gases as
mechanical agents, Davy admits that there will
be some difficulty; "the materials of the apparatus
must be as strong and as perfectly joined as
those used by Mr. Perkins in his high-pressure
steam-engine: but the small differences of temperature
to produce an elastic force equal to the pressure
of many atmospheres, will render the risk of
explosion extremely small;" and he adds, "that if
future experiments should realize the views here
developed, the mere difference of temperature between
sunshine and shade, and air and water, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
the effects of evaporation from a moist surface, will
be sufficient to produce results, which have hitherto
been obtained only by a great expenditure of fuel."</p>

<p>If this be true, who can say that future generations
shall not perform their voyages in <em>gas</em>-vessels,
across the Atlantic Ocean, with no other fuel than
that which a common taper may supply? I fear,
however, that in this scientific reverie, Davy merely
looked at the difference of the sensible temperatures,
and entirely neglected, in his calculation, the
quantity of heat rendered latent during the change
of the liquid into the gaseous state; and which,
perhaps, is far more considerable in the application
of these fluids than in that of water; but even
in this latter case, the great expenditure of heat
in working the steam-engine, is in the portion rendered
latent, and which cannot, by any contrivance,
be brought again into operation, after it has performed
its duty. That a philosopher who had,
during the whole progress of his researches, directed
such unremitting attention to the subject
of Heat, should have wholly overlooked an objection
arising out of one of its most familiar phenomena,
is scarcely less extraordinary than his having,
on another occasion,<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> advanced to a conclusion in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
direct opposition to the very principle of Electricity,
which his own discoveries had established.</p>

<p>Davy succeeded in liquefying gases by a method
which, at first view, appears very paradoxical&mdash;<em>by
the application of heat!</em> The method consists in
placing them in one leg of a bent sealed tube, confined
by mercury, and applying heat to ether, or
alcohol, or water, in the other end. In this manner,
by the pressure of the vapour of ether, he liquefied
prussic gas and sulphurous acid gas; which gases,
on being reproduced, occasioned cold.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt, he thinks, that these
general facts of the condensation of the gases will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
have many practical applications. They offer, for
instance, easy methods of impregnating liquids with
carbonic acid and other gases, without mechanical
pressure. They afford means of producing great
diminutions of temperature, by the rapidity with
which large quantities of liquids may be rendered
aëriform; and as compression occasions similar
effects to cold, in preventing the formation of elastic
substances, there is great reason to believe that it
may be successfully employed for the preservation
of animal and vegetable substances for the purposes
of food.</p>

<p>Davy might also have added, that the same general
views will explain natural and other phenomena
not previously understood. They certainly afford
a plausible explanation of the nature of <em>blowers</em> in
coal-mines; and they may lead to more satisfactory
views on other subjects of geology. They assign
a limit to the expansive force of gas under increasing
pressure, and account for effects connected with the
<em>blasting</em> of rocks, which would otherwise appear
anomalous.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
It may be stated, greatly to the honour of Davy,
that there never occurred any question of scientific
interest or difficulty in which he did not cheerfully
offer his advice and assistance. Few Presidents of
the Royal Society have ever exerted their influence
and talents with so much unaffected zeal for the
promotion of scientific objects, and for the welfare
of scientific men. In the year 1821, the Great
Hafod copper-works, in the neighbourhood of Swansea,
were indicted for a nuisance, in consequence of
the alleged destructive effects of the fumes which
arose during the smelting of the ores. When we
learn that the amount of wages paid by the proprietors
of the works in this district exceeds 50,000<i>l.</i>,
per annum; that twelve thousand persons, at least,
derive their support from the smelting establishments;
that a sum of not less than 200,000<i>l.</i> sterling
is annually circulated in Glamorganshire and the
adjoining county, in consequence of their existence;
that they pay to the collieries no less than from
100,000<i>l.</i> to 110,000<i>l.</i> per annum for coal; that one
hundred and fifty vessels are employed in the conveyance
of ore, and, supposing each upon an average
to be manned by five seamen, that they give occupation
to seven hundred and fifty mariners,
a more serious calamity can scarcely be imagined
than the stoppage of such works: we may therefore
readily believe, that Davy entered most ardently
into the consideration of some plan by which the
fumes might be prevented, and the alleged nuisance
abated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
Through the kind attention of my friend Mr.
Vivian, I am enabled to insert the following letters.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO JOHN HENRY VIVIAN, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">London, Jan. 9, 1822.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>As you expressed a wish that I should commit to
writing those opinions which I mentioned in conversation,
when I had the pleasure of visiting you
at Marino, after inspecting your furnaces and witnessing
your experiments on the smoke arising from
them, I lose no time in complying with your desire.</p>

<p>It is evident that the copper ore cannot be properly
calcined without a copious admission of air
into the furnaces, which must cause the sulphurous
acid gas formed in the calcination to be mixed with
very large quantities of other elastic fluids, which presents
great mechanical, as well as chemical difficulties
to its condensation or decomposition.</p>

<p>To persons acquainted with chemistry, a number
of modes of effecting these objects are known. Of
condensation, for instance, by water, by the formation
of sulphuric acid, by alkaline lixivia, by alkaline
earths, &amp;c. Of decomposition, by hydrogen,
by charcoal, by hydro-carbonous substances, and by
metals; but to most of these methods there are
serious and insurmountable objections, depending
upon the diluted state of the acid gas, and the
expenses required.</p>

<p>To form sulphuric acid, or to decompose by charcoal
or hydrogen, or to condense by alkaline lixivia,
or by alkaline earths, from the nature of the works,
and of the operations for which they were intended,
I conceive impracticable except at an expense that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
could not be borne; and the only processes which
remain to be discussed are those by hydro-carbonous
substances, and by the action of water.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the gas may be decomposed
by the action of heated hydro-carbonous
gases from the distillation of coal; but for this purpose
there must be a new construction of the furnaces,
and more than double, probably triple, the
quantity of fuel would be required, supposing even
the Swansea coal to contain the common average of
bitumen; and this method must be infinitely more
expensive, and liable to many more objections, than
the one you have so ingeniously employed&mdash;absorption
by water.</p>

<p>As water costs nothing, and as a supply is entirely
in your power, the application of it offers comparatively
few difficulties; and it has the great advantage
of freeing the smoke from fluoric and arsenious
compounds, which would not be perfectly effected
by any other method.</p>

<p>The experiments of MM. Phillips and Faraday
prove, that your shower baths have already entirely
destroyed all the fluoric and arsenious fumes of the
smoke, and by a <em>certain</em> quantity of water, the smoke
may undoubtedly be entirely freed from sulphurous
acid gas.</p>

<p>This, <em>your own</em> plan, is the one that I strongly
recommend to you to proceed with, and, if necessary,
to extend.</p>

<p>Perhaps you may find an additional shower bath
near the colder part of the flue useful. I have no
idea that steam passed into the hot part of the flue
can be of the least service; but if passed out with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
the smoke through the stack, it may tend to convert
such residual portion of sulphurous acid gas,
exposed to fresh air, into sulphuric acid. Could
you not likewise try a stream of <em>cold</em> water passing
along the bottom of the horizontal flue?<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>I do not think the advantages of your improvements
can be fairly appreciated, till the effects of
your smoke are determined by actual experiments
and fair trials.</p>

<p class="signature">Yours, &amp;c.<br />
<span class="smcap j4">H. Davy</span>.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO THE SAME.</p>

<p class="date">London, May 12, 1823.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>I return you my thanks for the copies you were
so good as to send me of your work on the modes
you have adopted for rendering copper smoke innoxious,
&amp;c. I have read it with very great pleasure,
and I am sure there can be but one feeling,
and that of strong admiration, at the exertions you
have made, and the resources you have displayed,
in subduing the principal evils of one of our most
important national manufactures. I trust you will
have no more trouble on this subject, and that it will
only occur to you in an agreeable form, with the
high approbation as well as grateful feelings of your
neighbours; and that your example will be followed.</p>

<p>A Committee of the Royal Society has been formed
for investigating the causes of the decay of copper
sheeting in the Navy, as I mentioned to you.
The Navy Board has sent us a number of specimens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
of copper in different stages of decay. We have
our first meeting to examine them on Thursday,
and I shall have much pleasure in communicating
to you our results. I wish I could do it in person.</p>

<p>I am going into Hampshire on Sunday next to
fish near Fordingbridge for a week, and to try the
Avon and its tributary streams.</p>

<p>I was going to give you an account of some
experiments which Mr. Faraday has made by my
directions in generating gases in close vessels as
liquids, but I find I have not time. I have already
found an application of this discovery, which I hope
will supersede <em>steam</em>, as a difference of a few degrees
of temperature gives the elastic force of many
atmospheres.</p>

<p>Hoping to see you soon, I am, with best respects
to Mrs. Vivian, and love to the charming little
Bessy,</p>

<p class="signature2">My dear Sir, yours sincerely obliged,<br />
<span class="smcap j10">H. Davy.</span></p>

</div>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>I proceed now to relate the history of an elaborate
experimental enquiry, instituted for the purpose
of ascertaining the chemical nature and causes
of the well-known corrosive action of sea-water
upon metallic copper; in order, if possible, to obviate
that serious evil in naval economy&mdash;the rapid
decay of the copper sheathing on the bottoms of
our ships. An investigation which Sir Humphry
Davy commenced in the year 1823, and prosecuted
with his characteristic zeal and happy talent during
a considerable period; when, at length, paradoxical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
as it may appear, the truth of his theory was completely
established by the failure of his remedy!</p>

<p>From the several original documents which have
been placed at my disposal, and from the valuable
communications and kind assistance of my friend
Mr. Knowles, I trust I shall be enabled to offer to
the scientific reader a more complete and circumstantial
history of this admirable enquiry than has
been hitherto presented to the public.</p>

<p>The results he produced are equally interesting
and important, whether we contemplate them biographically,
as indicative of the peculiar genius by
which they were obtained; or, scientifically, in their
connexion with the electro-chemical theory, to the
farther developement and illustration of which they
have so powerfully contributed; or, economically,
as the probable means by which the hand of Time
may be averted, an increased durability imparted to
rapidly perishable works of art, and monuments of
human genius transmitted to posterity, in all their
freshness, through a long succession of ages.</p>

<p>It is probable that, in the earliest period of naval
architecture, some expedient<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> was practised, in order
to protect ships' bottoms from the ravages of
marine worms.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> The use of metallic sheathing, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
is of ancient date. The galley supposed to
have belonged to the Emperor Trajan was sheathed
with sheets of lead, which were fastened with copper
nails.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The same metal was also used in the
earlier periods of our naval history;<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and it is worthy
of remark, that the circumstances which led to
its disuse, were the rapid corrosion of the <em>rother
irons</em>, (from the formation of a Voltaic circle,) and
the accumulation of sea-weed.</p>

<p>In the year 1761, copper plates were first used as
sheathing on the Alarm frigate, of thirty-two guns;<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
a second underwent this operation in 1765, a third
in 1770, four in 1776, nine in 1777; and, in the
course of the three following years, the whole British
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
navy was coppered: an event which may be considered
as forming an important era in the naval
annals of the country.</p>

<p>The expense attending the use of copper for this
purpose, in consequence of its corrosion and decay
by salt-water, has always been felt as a serious objection
to its use, and various suggestions have from
time to time occurred, and numerous experiments
been made, in the hope of obviating the evil,<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> but
without any great degree of success.</p>

<p>The solution of the metal, however, has been
found to vary in degree at different anchorages: at
Sheerness, for instance, its rapidity is very great, in
consequence of the copper being subjected to the
alternate action of the sea, which flows in there
from the British Channel, and to the flux of water
down the two great rivers, the Thames and Medway,
loaded, as they necessarily must be, with the
products of animal and vegetable decomposition.</p>

<p>In order, if possible, to obtain a remedy for this
evil, the naval departments of the Government requested,
in the latter part of the year 1823, the
advice of the President and Council of the Royal
Society, as to the best mode of manufacturing copper
sheets, or of preserving them, while in use,
against the corrosive effects of oxidation.</p>

<p>Sir H. Davy charged himself with this enquiry;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
the results of which he communicated to the Royal
Society, in three elaborate memoirs. The first was
read on the 22nd of January 1824; the second, on
the 17th of June, in the same year; and the third,
and concluding paper, on the 9th of June 1825.</p>

<p>A very general belief prevailed, that sea-water
had little or no action on <em>pure</em> copper, and that the
rapid decay of that metal on certain ships was
owing to its impurity. On submitting, however,
various specimens of copper to the action of the sea-water,
Sir H. Davy came to a conclusion, in direct
opposition to such an opinion;<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> and Mr. Knowles
informed me, in a late conversation upon the subject,
that the attempts to purify the metal, since
the Government has manufactured its own copper
sheathing, has been the cause of its more rapid
decay. It will however presently appear, that the
relative durability of the metallic sheets must also
be influenced by circumstances wholly independent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
of their quality, some of which are very probably,
even in our present advanced state of chemical
knowledge, not thoroughly understood.</p>

<p>Sir H. Davy, on entering upon the examination
of this subject, very justly considered, that to ascertain
the exact nature of the chemical changes which
take place in sea-water, by the agency of copper,
ought to be the first step in the enquiry; for, unless
the cause were thoroughly understood, how could
the evil be remedied?</p>

<p>On keeping a polished piece of copper in contact
with sea-water, the following were the effects which
successively presented themselves. In the course
of two or three hours, the surface of the metal exhibited
a yellow tarnish, and the water in which it
was immersed contracted a cloudiness, the hue of
which was at first white, but gradually became
green. In less than a day, a bluish-green precipitate
appeared, and constantly continued to accumulate
in the bottom of the vessel; at the same time,
the surface of the copper corroded, appearing red in
the water, and grass-green where it was in contact
with air. Upon this grass-green matter carbonate
of soda formed; and these changes continued until
the water became much less saline. The green precipitate
he ascertained to consist of an insoluble
compound of copper, (which he thinks may be considered
as a <em>hydrated sub-muriate</em>,) and hydrate of
magnesia.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>According to his own views of the nature of chlorine,
he immediately perceived that neither soda nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
magnesia could appear in sea-water by the action of
a metal, unless in consequence of an absorption or
transfer of oxygen, which in this case must either
be derived from the atmosphere, or from the decomposition
of water: his experiments determined that
the former was the source which supplied it. By
reasoning upon these phenomena, and applying for
their explanation his electro-chemical theory, which
had shown that chemical attractions may be exalted,
modified, or destroyed, by changes in the electrical
states of bodies, he was led to the discovery of a
remedy for the corrosion of copper, by the very
principle which enabled him, sixteen years before,
to decompose the fixed alkalies.</p>

<p>When he considered that copper is but weakly
positive in the electro-chemical scale, and that it
can only act upon sea-water when in a positive
state, it immediately occurred to him that, if it
could be rendered slightly negative, the corroding
action of sea-water upon it would be null. But how
was this to be effected? At first, he thought of
using a Voltaic battery; but this could hardly be
applicable in practice. He next thought of the
contact of zinc, tin, or iron; but he was prevented
for some time from trying this, by the recollection
that the copper in the Voltaic battery, as well as
the zinc, was dissolved by the action of dilute nitric
acid; and by the fear, that too large a mass of oxidable
metal would be required to produce decisive
results. After reflecting, however, on the slow and
weak action of sea-water on copper, and the small
difference which must exist between their electrical
powers; and knowing that a very feeble chemical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
action would be destroyed by a very feeble electrical
force, he was encouraged to proceed; and the
results were highly satisfactory and conclusive. A
piece of zinc, not larger than a pea, or the point of a
small iron nail, was found fully adequate to preserve
forty or fifty square inches of copper,&mdash;and this,
wherever it was placed, whether at the top, bottom,
or in the middle of the sheet of copper, and whether
the copper was straight or bent, or made into coils.
And where the connexion between the different
pieces of copper was completed by wires, or thin
filaments of the fortieth or fiftieth of an inch in diameter,
the effect was the same; every side, every
surface, every particle of the copper, remained bright;
whilst the iron, or the zinc, was slowly corroded.</p>

<p>A piece of thick sheet copper, containing on both
sides about sixty square inches, was cut in such a
manner as to form seven divisions, connected only
by the smallest filaments that could be left, and a
mass of zinc, of the fifth of an inch in diameter, was
soldered to the upper division. The whole was
plunged under sea-water; the copper remained perfectly
polished. The same experiment was repeated
with iron, and after the lapse of a month, the copper
was in both instances found as bright as when it was
first introduced; whilst similar pieces of copper, undefended,
underwent in the same water very considerable
corrosion, and produced a large quantity of
green deposit in the bottom of the vessel.</p>

<p>Numerous other experiments were performed, and
with results equally conclusive of the truth of the
theory which had suggested them.</p>

<p>There was however one point which still remained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
for enquiry. As the ocean may be considered
in its relation to the quantity of copper in a
ship, as an infinitely extended conductor, it became
necessary to ascertain whether that circumstance
would influence the results. For this purpose, he
placed two very fine copper wires, one undefended,
the other defended by a particle of zinc, in a very
large vessel of sea-water, which water might be considered
to bear the same relation to so minute a
portion of metal, as the sea to the metallic sheathing
of a ship. The result was perfectly satisfactory.
The defended copper underwent no change; the undefended
tarnished, and deposited a green powder.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>Davy having thus satisfied his own mind as to
the truth of his views, communicated to Government,
in January 1824, the important fact of his
having discovered a remedy for the evil of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
they had complained; and that the corrosion of the
copper sheathing of his Majesty's ships might be
prevented by rendering the copper electro-positive,
by means of the contact of tin, zinc, lead, iron, or
any other easily oxidable metal; and that he was
prepared to carry his plan into effect.</p>

<p>A proposition from a philosopher of such known
science, and upon a subject of such great importance
to the navigation and commerce of the country,
immediately obtained all the attention it deserved;
and an order was made that the plan of protection
should, under the superintendence of Sir H. Davy, be
forthwith tried upon the bottom of a sailing cutter.</p>

<p>To give to his discovery farther publicity, Sir
Humphry requested that three models of ships might
be exhibited in the spacious hall of the Navy Office
in Somerset House; the copper of one of which
he proposed should be protected by bands of zinc,
that of another by plates of wrought iron soldered
on the sheathing, while the third should have its
copper exposed without any protection whatever.</p>

<p>These models were floated in sea-water for several
months; and the experiment fully confirmed the
results he had previously obtained in his laboratory.
The models were from time to time examined by
persons of the highest scientific character, as well as
by others of great naval celebrity; and so alluring
was the theory, and so conclusive the experiments,
that, instead of waiting the result of the slow but
more certain ordeal to which the plan had been submitted,
it was immediately put into extensive practice,
both in the Government service and on the
bottoms of ships belonging to private individuals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
To those the least acquainted with the principles
of Voltaic action, it was only necessary to state the
proposition, in order to command their assent to
its truth. The utility of the plan therefore was
never questioned, but the claims of Davy to the
originality of the invention were doomed to meet
with immediate opposition.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>The correctness of the principle having been established,
it became, in the next place, necessary to
determine the most eligible metal to be used for
protection; the proportion which it must bear to
the surface of the copper-sheathing below the waterline;
the form least likely to offer resistance to the
sea, and to impede the sailing of the vessel; and
lastly, its most convenient position on the ship's
bottom. To ascertain these several points, Lord
Melville and the Lords of the Admiralty desired
the Commissioners of the Navy Board, and of the
Dock-yards, to afford Sir Humphry every assistance
and facility for prosecuting the necessary experiments;
and he accordingly made many very extensive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
trials, not only on copper sheets which were
immersed in the sea, but also on the bottoms of a
considerable number of boats which had been coppered
for that purpose, and exposed to the flow of
the tide in Portsmouth harbour; upon which occasions
he varied the nature as well as the proportions
of the protecting metal. The results were communicated
to the Royal Society, and they constituted
the materials for his second memoir on the subject.</p>

<p>"When the metallic protector was from 1/20 to
1/110 parts of its surface, there was no corrosion nor
decay of the copper; with smaller quantities, such
as from 1/200 to 1/400, the copper underwent a loss of
weight, which was greater in proportion as the protector
was smaller; and, as a proof of the universality
of the principle, it was found that even 1/1000 part
of cast iron saved a certain proportion of the copper.</p>

<p>"The sheeting of boats and ships, protected by
the contact of zinc, or cast and malleable iron in
different proportions, compared with those of similar
boats and sides of ships unprotected, exhibited bright
surfaces; whilst the unprotected copper underwent
rapid corrosion, becoming first red, then green, and
losing a part of its substance in scales. Fortunately,
in the course of these experiments, it was proved
that cast iron, the substance which is cheapest and
most easily procured, is likewise most fitted for the
protection of the copper. It lasts longer than malleable
iron, or zinc; and the plumbaginous substance
which is left by the action of sea-water upon it, retains
the original form of the iron, and does not impede
the electrical action of the remaining metal."</p>

<p>In the earlier stage of the investigation, it had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
been suggested by Mr. Knowles, and several other persons,
that by rendering the copper innoxious, it was
probable sea-weeds might adhere to the sheets; but
this objection he answered by stating, that negative
electricity could not be supposed favourable to animal
and vegetable life; and as it occasioned the
deposition of magnesia, a substance exceedingly noxious
to land vegetables, upon the copper surface, he
entertained no difficulty upon that subject: in this,
however, he was fatally mistaken. He found, after
a trial of several weeks, that the metallic surface
became coated with carbonate of lime and magnesia,
and that, under such circumstances, weeds adhered
to the coatings, and marine insects collected upon
them; but at the same time he observed, that when
the proportion of cast iron, or zinc, was below 1/150, the
electrical power of the copper being less negative,
no such deposition occurred; and that although the
surface had undergone a slight degree of solution, it
remained perfectly clean: a fact which he considered
of great importance, as it pointed out the <em>limits of
protection</em>; and makes the application of a <em>very small</em>
quantity of the oxidable metal more advantageous,
in fact, than that of a larger one.</p>

<p>During the course of these experiments, many
singular facts occurred to him, which tended to confirm
his views of electro-chemical action. Amongst
the various details which remained for his investigation,
the relations between the surface of the protector,
and that of the copper sheathing, under the
different circumstances of temperature, saltness of
the sea, and rapidity of the ship's motion, presented
themselves as objects of great importance; and an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
opportunity occurred which enabled him to pursue
them by actual observation and experiment.</p>

<p>In the month of June 1824, a steam-vessel, H.M.
ship the Comet, was, at the express request of the
King of Denmark, ordered to proceed to Heligoland,
for the purpose of fixing with precision, by
means of numerous chronometers, the longitude of
that island, in order to connect the Danish with the
British survey; and the Board of Longitude having
recommended that the voyage should be extended
as far as the Naze of Norway, for the purpose of
ascertaining also the longitude of that important
point, Sir H. Davy thought that this vessel would
afford him the means of performing his desired experiments
upon protected and unprotected copper
sheets, when under the influence of rapid motion;
and upon application to the Board of Admiralty,
he obtained the entire disposal of the vessel after
the required observations had been completed, as
long as the season would allow her going to sea;
and, that every facility might be afforded him, a
skilful carpenter was put on board, to prepare whatever
might be necessary for the prosecution of the
enquiry.</p>

<p>For the following account of his adventures upon
this occasion I am indebted to Dr. Tiarks, who, in
his character of astronomical observer, superintended
the expedition.</p>

<p>In the first instance, Davy directed to be constructed
a number of oblong, rectangular, thin plates
of copper, the surface of which should exceed that
of a square foot: in the centre of these plates was
fastened a slip of copper, by means of which other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
pieces of copper, which had small plates of iron of
various dimensions attached to them, were fixed to
the plate, by merely sliding them into the groove
thus prepared for their reception. The plates were
all carefully weighed previously to the experiment,
and the pieces of iron were considered as representing
the various proportions of iron and copper surfaces
within whose limits Sir H. Davy had been led, by
former experiments, to expect that the best proportion
would be found. These plates were afterwards
slipped into wooden frames, and nailed to the
ship's side, over a piece of thick canvass, for the
purpose of intercepting every possible communication
between them and the copper sheathing.</p>

<p>It was proposed that, after each trip, these plates
should be accurately weighed, in order to ascertain
the loss which they severally might sustain from the
corrosive action of the sea, while thus protected by
different proportions of iron surface; and, to ensure
every possible accuracy, he carried with him the
excellent balance, constructed by Ramsden, which
is in possession of the Royal Society.</p>

<p>Sir H. Davy, accompanied by Lord Clifton, embarked
at Greenwich on the 30th of June, and the
vessel arrived at Heligoland on the 2nd of July.
Here, as they remained not more than one day, the
plates were not examined, although the Master expressed
strong doubts as to their safety. The vessel
then proceeded, by order of Sir Humphry, to Norway,
a country which he was, for several reasons,
very desirous of visiting, especially for the sake of
determining a doubtful point in ornithology, upon
which he subsequently corresponded with Professor
Rheinhard, of Copenhagen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
The difference of longitude, also, between that
country and Greenwich, not having been accurately
ascertained, offered perhaps an additional reason for
thus deviating from a course which, it must be confessed,
was at variance with the original plan of the
expedition.</p>

<p>After a severe gale of wind on the 4th of July,
the vessel arrived, on the day following, at Rleve,
near Mandal, and afterwards proceeded to this latter
place, at which Davy remained for several days,
during which interval the vessel made a tour to the
Naze, and took in coal.</p>

<p>On the arrival of the vessel in the port, the plates
were immediately examined; but, to the great disappointment
of Sir Humphry, it was discovered
that every one of the protectors had been washed
away, and that most of the plates had sustained
considerable injury.</p>

<p>With the country around Mandal he was much
pleased; for, although it is far from being fertile,
the scenery is rendered exceedingly striking and
beautiful by the numerous lakes which wash the
feet of high and sometimes perpendicular mountains,
at that time clothed with the rich verdure of
their summer herbage.</p>

<p>Sir Humphry made several excursions into the
interior of the country, and derived much amusement
from angling in the lakes; and had it not
been from his own inspection of the roads, and the
information which he collected respecting them,
together with an indisposition of his fellow-traveller,
Lord Clifton, he would have made an extensive
land journey through the country; but, under the
existing circumstances, he determined to return to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
England through Denmark and Germany. He
therefore at once resolved to take the steam-boat
with him as far as Sweden, where the excellent
roads would enable him, without inconvenience, to
reach Gottenburg, and thence to continue his route
through Denmark to Germany. The vessel proceeded
accordingly to Christiansand, the chief town
of a country of the same name.</p>

<p>Having been provided with some spare plates and
protectors, he fixed them to the ship's side at Mandal,
as he was informed that the voyage could be
entirely performed within the rocks, with which
the whole coast of Norway is so plentifully studded;
but a short traverse through an open part of the sea,
not far from Mandal, again defeated his object.
The protectors were washed away, and no result was
obtained.</p>

<p>At Christiansand he remained a few days, in order
to try some new plates, which were constructed
there under his own inspection. Upon this occasion
he made an excursion to the falls of the Torjedahl,
distant about six miles from the town. The river
abounds with salmon, which were easily caught in
their descent from the falls, by an apparatus contrived
for that purpose. Sir Humphry amused himself
by teaching the inhabitants the operation of
<em>crimping</em>, and he declared the flavour of the fish to
be superior to any salmon he had ever tasted.</p>

<p>It was at Christiansand that he became acquainted
with the Norwegian race of ponies, so well adapted
for mountainous countries; and which, at his recommendation,
were afterwards introduced into England
by Mr. Knight, of Downton Castle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
From Christiansand the vessel proceeded on her
route eastward to Arendal, where she arrived on the
12th, after a passage of only a few hours. The
route lay entirely within the rocks,&mdash;and so narrow
were the passages, that the vessel could frequently
not pass the rocks on either side without touching
them.</p>

<p>At Arendal, which is the chief place of a remarkable
mining district, Sir Humphry was well received
by the Messrs. Dedehamys, two brothers, and the
leading merchants of the place, with whom he made
several excursions to the neighbouring mines. He
was also invited by them to meet at their beautiful
country seats the most respectable inhabitants of
the town.</p>

<p>In the house of Mr. Dedehamy, Davy was introduced
into Norwegian society, and, for the first
time, had an opportunity of witnessing the customs
and manners of the country.</p>

<p>A short time before dinner, the guests were summoned
to partake of pickled fish, anchovies, and
smoked salmon, with rum, brandy, and wine, which
were placed on small tables in the drawing-room in
which the company assembled. This custom of
taking salt provisions, together with spirits, just
before dinner, is very general in the North, and is
considered as the best means of preparing the stomach,
and of provoking an appetite for the approaching
meal.</p>

<p>The very numerous party, which, with the exception
of the hostess and her daughter, consisted
entirely of men, were then ushered into two large
rooms, one not being sufficiently spacious to accommodate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
them, and each person took his seat promiscuously.
At the beginning of the dinner, large
basins filled with sugar were carried round by the
host's daughter, followed by a servant, from which
each gentleman took a large handful. Sir Humphry,
surprised at so singular a ceremony, enquired
its meaning; when the host very good-humouredly
answered, that in Norway they thought, if the wine
was good it could not be spoiled by sugar,&mdash;and if
bad, that it would be improved by it. Davy immediately
followed the example of the company, and
helped himself to the sugar.</p>

<p>Amongst the party present were several members
of the Diet (Storthing), which had recently refused
the applications of the King for various grants of
money. This subject excited much animated conversation,
and the majority of the persons present
expressed their approbation at so bold and independent
a measure. This called forth a political
toast relating to the situation of their country; when
the whole company, elated with wine and conversation,
simultaneously burst forth into the national
chorus of Norway, which had been composed as a
prize poem during the short struggle against the
union of that country with Sweden, and which was
much admired by the Norwegians, and on all occasions
sung by them with the utmost enthusiasm of
feeling; but, notwithstanding the liberal politics of
the party, they drank Sir Humphry's toast&mdash;"<span class="smcap">The
King of Norway and Sweden</span>"&mdash;with much
apparent loyalty.</p>

<p>A succession of toasts followed, the last of which
recommended "<span class="smcap">The British Constitution as a</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
<span class="smcap">model for all the world</span>." With this sentiment
the festivities concluded&mdash;a momentary silence
ensued; the custom of the country assigned
to a stranger the honourable office of returning to
the host and hostess the thanks of the company for
their hospitable reception; all eyes were anxiously
fixed upon the English philosopher; and as soon as
he was made acquainted with the duty he was expected
to perform, he rose from his seat, and in
allusion to the sentiment so recently drunk in compliment
to himself, he proposed as a concluding
toast, "<span class="smcap">Norwegian hospitality a model for
all the world</span>."</p>

<p>From Arendal the vessel proceeded to Laurvig,
where she stopped only a few hours; but Sir Humphry
seized this opportunity to go on shore to view
the country, and he afterwards weighed the copper
plates which had been attached to the ship in Christiansand,
as the vessel was now to cross that deep
bay, at the bottom of which is situated Christiana,
the capital of the kingdom. The few plates were
found to be in good order; and the results, which
however must be allowed to have been very incomplete,
confirmed, as far as they went, the conclusions
to which he had been led by former experiments,
viz. that 1/200 of iron surface was the proportion best
calculated to defend the copper, without so overprotecting
it as to favour the adhesion of marine
productions; while they moreover proved that there
is a mechanical as well as a chemical wear of the
copper, which, in the most exposed part of the ship,
and in the most rapid course, bears a relation to it
of nearly 2 to 4.55.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
The country increased in fertility towards the
eastern parts of it; but it possessed much less
beauty than the neighbourhood of Mandal.</p>

<p>As soon as Davy perceived that the vessel had to
pass near the mouth of the Glommen, the largest
river of Norway, he directed that she should enter
it. Steam-boats appeared to have been entirely unknown
in that part of the country. The inhabitants
of the town of Frederickstadt were alarmed by the
belief that the vessel was on fire, and they ran down
to the beach in multitudes. As the vessel proceeded
up the river, the people every where left their work,
looked on awhile in silent amazement, and then
shouted with delight.</p>

<p>The vessel anchored a mile below the great fall of
the Glommen, called <i>Sarpen</i>, and which Davy visited
on the following day (July 15). Three Kings
of Denmark have visited this fall, and a name commemorates
the spot whence they viewed this grand
scene of nature. The fall is not one perpendicular
descent, but consists of three sheets of water closely
succeeding each other; and, by means of a barometer,
he ascertained the entire altitude to be little more
than a hundred feet. In comparing the character
of this waterfall with those of the others he had
visited, he observes, that size is merely comparative;
and that he prefers the Velino at Terni, on account
of the harmony that exists in all its parts. It displays
all the force and power of the element, in its
rapid and precipitous descent; and you feel that
even man would be nothing in its waves, and would
be dashed to pieces by its force. The whole scene
is embraced at once by the eye, and the effect is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
almost as sublime as that of the Glommen, where
the river is at least one hundred times as large; for
the Glommen falls, as it were, from a whole valley
upon a mountain of granite; and unless where you
see the giant pines of Norway, fifty or sixty feet in
height, carried down by it and swimming in its
whirlpools like straws, you have no idea of its magnitude
and power. Considering these waterfalls in
all their relations, he is disposed to think, that while
that of Velino is the most perfect and beautiful, the
fall of the Glommen is the most awful.</p>

<p>On both sides of this fall are extensive saw-mills,
with machinery of very imperfect construction.
Davy spent some time with the proprietors of these
mills, who were acquainted with the English language,
and showed him every attention in their
power. As an angler, he spoke with regret of the
immense quantity of sawdust which floated in the
water, and formed almost hills along the banks, and
which, he observed, must be poisonous to the fish,
by sometimes choking their gills, and interfering
with their respiration.</p>

<p>From the Glommen the steam-vessel passed
through the Svinesund to Strömstadt, the first town
in Sweden beyond the frontier of Norway, from
which Charles XII. essayed to besiege the neighbouring
fortress of Frederickstadt in Norway.
From Strömstadt, Davy set out on the 17th of July,
and reached Gottenburg by land in two days, where
he remained for a short time, in consequence of a
slight indisposition. On his journey, he had a conversation
with Oscar, the Crown Prince of Denmark,
who, under the direction of Berzelius, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
diligently devoted himself to the study of chemistry.
He conversed with our philosopher upon various
subjects connected with that science; and Davy, on
his return to England, declared that he had never
met with a more enlightened person.</p>

<p>The Crown Prince expressed great surprise, as
indeed did every body in Sweden, on hearing that it
was not Davy's intention to visit Professor Berzelius
at Stockholm; and his astonishment was still
farther increased, when he was informed by himself,
that he came to Norway and Sweden with no other
view than to enjoy the diversion of hunting and
fishing! He however did by accident afterwards
meet Berzelius, but his interview was but of short
duration.</p>

<p>From Gottenburg he hastened to Copenhagen,
where he renewed his acquaintance with Prince
Christian of Denmark, cousin of the King, and heir
presumptive of the crown; in whose company he
had some years before observed an eruption of
Mount Vesuvius. He also visited Professor Oersted,
and earnestly requested that he might see the apparatus
by which that philosopher had made those
electro-magnetic experiments which had rendered
his name so celebrated throughout Europe.</p>

<p>He next proceeded to Neuburg and Altona, where
he intended to re-embark for England in the steam-vessel
which had, during the interval of his continental
tour, made a voyage to England, and was
again on her way to the Elbe. At the suggestion,
however, of Professor Schumacher, the astronomical
professor at Copenhagen, but residing at Altona, in
whose society he passed a great portion of his time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
he accompanied that gentleman to Bremen, in order
to make the acquaintance of the venerable Dr.
Olbers, who, since his retirement from an extensive
medical practice, had entirely devoted his time to
the pursuit of his favourite science astronomy; as
well as to be introduced to Professor Gauss, of Gottingen,
who happened to be at that time carrying
on his geodetical operations for the admeasurement
of the kingdom of Hanover.</p>

<p>Davy expressed a great desire to see the telescope
with which Dr. Olbers had discovered the two
planets, Pallas and Vesta, and which to his great
surprise turned out to be a very ordinary instrument.
His personal intercourse with these two
celebrated philosophers appeared to afford him the
highest satisfaction; and he spent two days most
agreeably in their society.</p>

<p>In his "Salmonia," he gives us some account of
his adventures as an angler during this short excursion
to Norway and Sweden. "All the Norwegian
rivers," says he, "that I tried (and they were in the
southern parts) contained salmon. I fished in the
Glommen, one of the largest rivers in Europe; in
the Mandals, which appeared to me the best fitted
for taking salmon; and in the Arendal; but, though
I saw salmon rise in these rivers, I never took a fish
larger than a sea-trout; of these I always caught
many&mdash;and even in the <em>fiords</em>, or small inland salt-water
bays; but, I think, never any one more than
a pound in weight. It is true that I was in Norway
in the beginning of July, in exceedingly bright
weather, and when there was no night; for even at
twelve o'clock the sky was so bright, that I read the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
smallest print in the columns of a newspaper. I
was in Sweden later&mdash;in August: I fished in the
magnificent Gotha, below that grand fall, Trollhetta,
which to see is worth a voyage from England; but I
never raised there any fish worth taking. I caught,
in this noble stream, a little trout about as long as
my hand; and the only fish I got to eat at Trollhetta
was bream."</p>

<p>He again embarked, on the 14th of August, on
board the Comet steam-vessel, which had ascended
the Weser as high as her draught of water would
allow, and reached England, after a very boisterous
passage, on the 17th of the same month; indeed,
the vessel left the mouth of the Weser with a contrary
wind, and the pilot was unwilling to put to
sea, but Davy insisted on proceeding without delay.
During the whole passage he suffered extremely
from sea-sickness, and in a letter written to Professor
Schumacher, shortly after landing, he remarks
that "the sea is a glorious dominion, but a wretched
habitation."</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>On the 9th of June 1825, Sir Humphry read before
the Royal Society his third and most elaborate
paper upon Copper sheathing, entitled "Farther
Researches on the Preservation of Metals by Electro-chemical
Means."</p>

<p>In this memoir, he states it to be his belief, that
there is nothing in the poisonous nature of the copper
to prevent the adhesion of weeds and testaceous
animals; for he observes, that they will readily adhere
to the poisonous salts of lead which commonly
form upon the metal protecting the fore-part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
keel; and even upon copper, provided it be in such
a state of chemical combination as to be insoluble.
It is then, in his opinion, the <em>solution</em> of the metal&mdash;the
<em>wear</em> of its surface, by keeping it smooth, which
prevents the adhesion of foreign matter. Whenever
the copper is unequally worn, deposits will,
without doubt, rest in the rough parts, or depressions
in the metal, and afford a soil or bed in which
sea-weeds can fix their roots, and to which zoophytes
and shell-fish can adhere; but there is another cause
of foulness on the protected sheathing, arising from
the deposit of earthy matter upon the copper, in
consequence of its electro-negative condition.</p>

<p>In relation to this subject, Davy has offered some
observations upon the effects produced by partial
formations of rust, which appear to me to be exceedingly
interesting and important.</p>

<p>When copper has been applied to the bottom of a
ship for a certain time, he says, a green coating, or
rust, consisting of oxide, sub-muriate, and carbonate
of copper, forms upon it; not equally throughout,
but partially, and which, it is evident, must produce
a <em>secondary</em>, partial, and unequal action, since
those substances are negative with respect to metallic
copper, and will consequently, by producing with
it a Voltaic circuit, occasion a more rapid corrosion
of those parts still exposed to sea-water: from this
cause, sheets are often found perforated with holes
in one part, after having been used for five or six
years; while in other parts they are comparatively
sound.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> In like manner, the heads of the mixed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
metal nails, consisting of copper alloyed by a small
quantity of tin, which are in common use in the
Navy, give rise to oxides that are negative with
respect to the copper, so that the latter is often
worn into deep and irregular cavities in their
vicinity.</p>

<p>A series of very interesting experiments, fully
detailed in this memoir, which were instituted for
the purpose of ascertaining the extent of the diminution
of electrical action in instances of imperfect
or irregular conducting surfaces, led him to the
general conclusion, that a very small quantity of the
imperfect or fluid conductor was sufficient to transmit
the electrical power, or to complete the chain.
This induced him to try whether copper, if nailed
upon wood, and protected merely by zinc or iron on
its <em>under</em> surface, or on that next the wood, might
not be defended from corrosion: a question of great
practical moment with regard to the arrangement of
protectors. For this purpose, he covered a piece of
wood with small sheets of copper, a nail of zinc of
about 1/100 part of the surface having been previously
driven into the wood: the copper surface remained
perfectly bright in sea-water for many weeks; and
when the result was examined, it was found that
the zinc had only suffered partial corrosion; that
the wood was moist, and that, on the interior of the
copper there was a considerable portion of revived
zinc, so that the negative electricity, by its operation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
provided materials for its future and constant
excitement. In several trials of the same kind, iron
was used with similar results; and in all these experiments
there appeared to be this peculiarity in the
appearance of the copper, that unless the protecting
metal below was in a large mass, there were no depositions
of calcareous or magnesian earths upon the
metal; it was clean and bright, but never coated.
The copper in these experiments was nailed sometimes
upon paper, sometimes upon the mere wood,
and sometimes upon linen; and the communication
was partially interrupted between the external and
internal surfaces by cement; but even one side or
junction of a sheet seemed to allow sufficient communication
between the moisture on the under surface
and the sea-water without, to produce the electrical
effect of preservation. This last experiment
of Davy is of greater importance than may at first
appear, in showing what a small proportion of conducting
fluid will complete a circuit, and in thus
explaining phenomena, as I shall presently show,
which might not otherwise be suspected to have an
electrical origin.</p>

<p>These results upon perfect and imperfect conductors
led him to another enquiry, important as it
relates to the practical application of the principle,
namely, as to the extent and nature of the contact
or relation between the copper and the preserving
metal. He was unable to produce any protecting
action of zinc or iron upon copper through the
thinnest stratum of air, or the finest leaf of mica, or
of dry paper; but the action of the metals did not
seem to be much impaired by the ordinary coating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
of oxide or rust; nor was it destroyed when the
finest bibulous, or <em>silver-paper</em>, as it is commonly
called, was between them, being moistened with
sea-water. He made an experiment with different
folds of this paper. Pieces of copper were covered
with one, two, three, four, five, and six folds; and
over them were placed pieces of zinc, which were
fastened closely to them by thread; each piece of
copper, thus protected, was exposed in a vessel of
sea-water, so that the folds of paper were all moist.</p>

<p>It was found in the case in which a single leaf of
paper was between the zinc and the copper, there
was no corrosion of the copper; in the case in which
there were two leaves, there was a very slight effect;
with three, the corrosion was distinct; and it increased,
till with six folds the protecting power appeared
to be lost; and in the case of the single leaf,
the result differed only from that produced by immediate
contact, in there not being any deposition
of earthy matter. Other experiments likewise
proved that there was no absolute contact of the
metals through the moist paper; for, although a
thin plate of mica, as before stated, entirely destroyed
the protecting effect of zinc, yet when a
hole was made in it, so as to admit a very thin layer
of moisture between the zinc and copper, the corrosion
of the latter, though not prevented, was considerably
diminished.</p>

<p>The experimental part of this paper concludes
with an account of various trials to determine the
electro-chemical powers of metals in menstrua out of
the contact, or to a certain extent removed from the
contact of air; in order, if possible, to diminish the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
rapid waste of the protecting metals. In the progress
of these experiments he exhibits, in a most
beautiful manner, the singular effect of different
proportions of a fixed alkali, when mixed with sea-water,
in rendering the iron, in its Voltaic connection
with copper, more or less negative.</p>

<p>He terminates the paper with some observations
of a practical nature, relative to the best modes of
rendering iron applicable to the purposes of protection;
but, as these have been already embodied in
the investigation, it is not necessary to notice them
farther in this place.</p>

<p>That I may give to the history of this subject all
the perspicuity which it can derive from the connexion
of its several parts, I shall now, in defiance
of chronological order, proceed to consider his last
Bakerian Lecture, "On the Relations of Electrical
Changes," which was read before the Royal Society,
on the 8th of June 1826. In which, after referring
to his former papers on the chemical agencies of
electricity, and the general laws of decomposition
which were developed in them, he enters into some
historical details respecting the origin and progress
of electro-chemical science; being induced so to do,
from a knowledge of the very erroneous statements
which had been published upon the subject abroad,
and repeated in this country. At the conclusion of
this lecture, in reverting to the subject of Voltaic
protection, he says: "A great variety of experiments,
made in different parts of the world, have proved
the full efficacy of the electro-chemical means of
preserving metals, particularly the copper sheathing
of ships; but a hope I had once indulged, that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
peculiar electrical state would prevent the adhesion
of weeds or insects, has not been realized; protected
ships have often indeed returned, after long voyages,
perfectly bright,<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> and cleaner than unprotected
ships; yet this is not always the case; and
though the <em>whole</em> of the copper may be preserved
from chemical solution in steam-vessels (from the
rapidity of their motion) by these means,&mdash;yet they
must be adopted in common ships only so as to preserve
a portion,&mdash;so applied, as to suffer a certain
solution of the copper;<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> and an absolute remedy
for adhesions is to be sought for by other more refined
means of protection, and which appear to be
indicated by these researches.</p>

<p>"The nails used in ships are an alloy of copper
and tin, which I find to be slightly negative with
respect to copper, and it is on these nails that the
first adhesions uniformly take place: a slightly positive
and slightly decomposable alloy would probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
prevent this effect, and I have made some experiments
favourable to the idea."</p>

<p>He next proceeds to state some circumstances, in
addition to those he had formerly noticed, by which
the electrical relations of copper are altered. "I
found," says he, "copper hardened by hammering,
<em>negative</em> to rolled copper;&mdash;copper (to use the technical
language of manufacturers) both <em>over-poled</em>
and <em>under-poled</em>,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> containing, in one case, probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
a little charcoal, and in the other a little oxide,
<em>negative</em> to pure copper. A specimen of brittle copper,
put into my hands by Mr. Vivian, but in which
no impurity could be detected, was negative with
respect to soft copper. In general, very minute
quantities of the oxidable metals render the alloy
positive, unless it becomes harder, in which case it
is generally negative."</p>

<p>These are important facts, and should dispose
those who may preside over judicial enquiries, to
pause before they infer the inferiority of copper
sheeting from the rapidity of its decay.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>&mdash;I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
now concluded a review of those admirable researches
which led Sir Humphry Davy to suggest
and mature a plan for arresting the corrosion of the
copper sheathing of vessels by Voltaic action. Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
Babbage has said that he was authorised in stating,
that "this was regarded by Laplace as the greatest
of Davy's discoveries." I do not think, however,
that it should be considered in the light of a separate
performance: we do injustice to the philosopher by
regarding it as an independent and isolated discovery;
for it was the result of a long series of
enquiries, which commenced by establishing the
laws of electro-chemistry,&mdash;which led him to the
decomposition of the alkalies and earths,&mdash;suggested
to his unwearied genius a succession of novel researches,
in a new field of enquiry,&mdash;and concluded,
as we have seen, in producing the most striking
results by means of the greatest simplicity. Not
once during the progress of this enquiry had he any
occasion to retrace his steps for the purpose of correction:
justly has he observed in his last Bakerian
Lecture, that, notwithstanding the various novel
views which have been brought forward in this and
other countries, and the great activity and extension
of science, it is peculiarly satisfactory to find that he
has nothing to alter in the fundamental theory laid
down in his original communication; and which,
after the lapse of twenty years, has continued, as it
was in the beginning, the guide and foundation of
all his researches.</p>

<p>The President and Council of the Royal Society
appear to have been swayed by this consideration,
when they adjudged to him "A Royal Medal,<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
his Bakerian Lecture on the relations of electrical
changes, considered as the last link, in order of
time, of the splendid chain of discoveries in chemical
electricity, which have been continued for so many
years of his valuable life."</p>

<p>Thus had Davy now received from the Royal
Society all the honours they were capable of conferring
upon him. In the year 1805, they adjudged
to him the medal on Sir Godfrey Copley's donation
for his various communications published in the
Philosophical Transactions; in 1817, they awarded
him the Rumford medals for his papers on combustion
and flame; and in 1827, upon the grounds
just stated, the President and Council expressed
their unabated admiration by conferring upon him
the only medal which remained for his acceptance&mdash;that
which had been recently founded by their
patron, his late Majesty.</p>

<p>Having thus disposed of the speculative part of
his admirable enquiry, it will be interesting to pause
in our narrative, in order to take a philosophical
review of the progress of Voltaic discovery, in its
relations to this particular object. It is a subject
well calculated to afford a valuable lesson to the experimentalist,
and at the same time to furnish illustrations,
more striking even than that of the safety-lamp,
of the necessity of that complicated species of
machinery, without which the human mind is frequently
unable to grapple with the simplicities of
truth. It is true, that the fact of a galvanic effect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
being excited by the contact of two dissimilar metals
was noticed in the earliest stages of the enquiry,
but it is equally evident that the phenomena which
attended it, and the laws by which it was directed,
required for their discovery and elucidation the
assistance of the Voltaic battery. In reference to
Davy, it may be here repeated, that the power of
obtaining simple results, through complicated means,
was one of the most distinguishing features of his
genius.</p>

<p>It has been stated, that the Alarm frigate, the
first coppered ship in our Navy, displayed very striking
evidence of the effect of Voltaic action, in the
rapid corrosion of its iron.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> As early as 1783, after
copper sheathing had become general, the Government
issued orders that all the bolts under the line
of fluitation should, in future, be of copper; but at
that period, it was not possible that any idea could
be entertained as to the true nature of the operation
by which the iron was thus rapidly corroded, for it
was only in the year 1797 that Dr. Ash noticed,
for the first time, a phenomenon which was subsequently
referred to the action of a simple Voltaic
circuit.</p>

<p>It is a very curious circumstance in the history of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
this subject, that, for many years after the Voltaic
influence had been recognised as the agent in metallic
corrosion, so far from the existence of the accompanying
phenomenon of preservation being suspected,
it was even supposed that the metals mutually
corroded each other. At so late a date as
1813, we find Davy himself, in the letter addressed
to M. Alavair, published in these memoirs,<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> dwelling
upon the necessity of avoiding metallic contact, in
order to prevent <em>corrosion</em>, without throwing out
the most distant hint as to the simultaneous production
of a converse effect.</p>

<p>The first distinct notice of a metal being preserved
from oxidation by the contact of a dissimilar
metal, is at once referred to a chemical law, without
a reference even to its possible connection with Voltaic
action; and, striking as the fact may now appear,
it never attracted much attention. M. Proust
observed, that although copper vessels be so imperfectly
tinned, as to leave portions of the surface uncovered,
still, in cooking utensils, we shall be equally
protected from the poisonous effects of the former
metal; because, says he, the superior readiness with
which tin is oxidized and acted upon by acids, when
compared with copper, will not allow this latter
metal to appropriate to itself a single atom of oxygen.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
The same chemist observes, that if lead be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
associated with tin, it will be incapable of furnishing
to acids any saturnine impregnation, since the latter,
being more oxidable than the former, will exclusively
dissolve, and thus prevent the former from
being attacked.</p>

<p>Whether the principle of Voltaic protection be
applicable or not to the purpose of preserving copper
sheathing, it is evident that it will suggest numerous
other expedients of high importance in the
arts, while it will explain phenomena previously unintelligible.
By introducing a piece of zinc, or tin,
into the iron boiler of the steam-engine, we may
prevent the danger of explosion, which generally
arises, especially where salt-water is used, as in those
of steam-boats, from the wear of one part of the
boiler. Another important application is in the prevention
of the wear of the paddles, or wheels, which
are rapidly dissolved by salt-water.</p>

<p>Mr. Pepys has also extended the principle for the
preservation of steel instruments by guards of zinc:
razors and lancets may be thus defended with perfect
success. In the construction of monuments
which are to transmit to posterity the record of important
events, the artist will be careful in avoiding
the contact of different metals: it is thus that the
Etruscan inscriptions, engraved upon pure lead, are
preserved to the present day; while medals of mixed
metals of a much more recent date are corroded.</p>

<p>Numerous are the facts daily presented before us,
which receive from this principle a satisfactory explanation.
To the philosopher, the examination of
its agencies will furnish a perpetual source of instruction
and amusement; and I will here enumerate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
a few simple instances of its effects: in the first
place, for the purpose of showing that, whenever
a principle or discovery involves or unfolds a law of
Nature, its applications are almost inexhaustible,
and that, however abstracted it may appear, it is
sooner or later employed for the common purposes
of life; and in the next place, in the hope of convincing
the reader, that there does not exist any
source of pleasure so extensive and so permanent as
that derived from the stores of philosophy. The
saunterer stumbles over the stone that may cross his
path, and vents only his vexation at the interruption;
but to the philosopher there is not a body,
animate or inanimate, with which he can come in
contact, that does not yield its treasures at his approach,
and contribute to extend the pleasures of
his existence.</p>

<p>I well remember some years ago, that, in passing
through Deptford, my curiosity was excited by the
extraordinary brilliancy of a portion of the gilded
sign of an inn in that town, while its other parts
had entirely lost their metallic lustre. Having obtained
a ladder, I ascended to the sign, in order, if
possible, to solve the problem that had so greatly
interested me: the mystery immediately vanished;
for an iron nail appeared in the centre of the spot,
which had protected the copper leaf for several
inches around it. Any person may easily satisfy
himself of the efficacy of such protection, in his
rambles through the metropolis, by noticing the
gilded, or rather coppered, sugar-loaves<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> so commonly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
suspended over the shops of grocers, when
he will frequently perceive that the parts into which
the iron supports have entered, unless the latter
have been painted, shine preeminently brilliant. If
a still more familiar example of the effect of a simple
Voltaic circuit be required, it is afforded by the iron
palisadoes, where the iron is constantly corroded at
its point of contact with the lead by which it is
cemented into the stone. These examples are
not only interesting from their simplicity, but from
their demonstrating the small quantity of a conducting
fluid which is sufficient to transmit the
electrical power, or to complete a simple circuit: a
fact which, it will be remembered, the experiments
of Davy had before established.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>As our knowledge advances, these principles will
no doubt derive other illustrations, and be found
capable of more extensive application; for as yet
we are but in the infancy of the enquiry. I have
lately been engaged in a series of experiments, the
results of which, I confidently anticipate, will lead
to some new facts connected with the changes produced
on the negative metal of a Voltaic circuit;
an account of which I hope shortly to submit to
the Royal Society. I shall on this occasion merely
notice one result, which appears to me to admit of
an immediate application to one of the most important
circumstances of life&mdash;the purity of water
contained in leaden cisterns.</p>

<p>My attention has for several years been directed
to the state of the water with which the metropolis
is supplied; and upon having been lately requested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
to propose a remedy for preventing the action of a
spring in the neighbourhood of London upon lead,
which it had been found to corrode in a very rapid
manner, I suggested the expediency of protecting
the pipes and cisterns with surfaces of iron; but
before such a plan was put in execution, I proposed
to try its efficacy in the laboratory:&mdash;the first result
was very startling; for, instead of preventing, as I
had anticipated, I found that it greatly increased,
the solution of the lead. After various experiments,
I arrived at the conclusion, that lead, when
rendered negative by iron, and placed in contact
with weak saline solutions,&mdash;such, for instance, as
common spring water,&mdash;was dissolved; in consequence
of the decomposition of the salts and the
transference of their elements according to the general
law, the acid passing to the iron, and the alkali
to the lead; and so powerfully is this latter body
acted upon by an alkali, that, if a slip of it be immersed
in a solution of potash or soda, its crystalline
texture is so rapidly developed, that its surface exhibits
an appearance similar to that presented by tin-plate,
and which is designated by the term <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">moirée</i>.</p>

<p>I apprehend that most of the anomalous cases of
the solution of lead in common water, which have
for so many years embarrassed the chemist, may
thus receive an explanation. An eminent physician
lately informed me, that some time since he
was called upon to attend a family who had evidently
suffered from the effects of saturnine poison,
and that he well remembers there was an iron pump
in the cistern that supplied the water. Upon
showing the results of my experiment to a no less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
eminent chemist, he was immediately reminded of a
circumstance which occurred at Islington, where the
water was found to corrode the lead in which it was
received: in this vessel there was an iron bar; and
the fact would not have attracted his notice, nor
have been impressed upon his recollection, but from
the unusual state of corrosion in which it appeared.</p>

<p>I shall conclude these observations by an account
of "the change which some musket balls, taken out
of Shrapnell's shells, had undergone," by Mr. Faraday,
and which is published in the 16th volume of
the Quarterly Journal of Science, for the year 1823.
This history is not only interesting on account of
the high chemical character of its author, but satisfactory
as being in direct opposition to previously
established facts; and cannot therefore have received
any bias from preconceived theory.</p>

<p>"Mr. Marsh of Woolwich gave me some musket
balls, which had been taken out of Shrapnell's shells.
The shells had lain in the bottoms of ships, and
probably had sea-water amongst them. When the
bullets are put in, the aperture is merely closed by
a common cork. These bullets were variously acted
upon: some were affected only superficially, others
more deeply, and some were entirely changed. The
substance produced is hard and brittle; it splits on
the ball, and presents an appearance like some hard
varieties of hæmatite; its colour is brown, becoming,
when heated, red; it fuses on platinum foil into
a yellow flaky substance like litharge. Powdered
and boiled in water, no muriatic acid or lead was
found in solution. It dissolved in nitric acid without
leaving any residuum, and the solution gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
very faint indications only of muriatic acid. It is a
<em>protoxide of lead</em>, perhaps formed, in some way, by
the galvanic action of the iron shell and the leaden
ball, assisted probably by the sea-water. It would
be very interesting to know the state of the shells
in which a change like this has taken place to any
extent. <em>It might have been expected, that as long as
any iron remained, the lead would have been preserved
in the metallic state.</em>"</p>

<p>In one experiment, I found that a piece of lead
protected by iron underwent solution in water containing
nitrate of potash, while it resisted the
action of very dilute nitric acid: upon this point,
however, farther enquiry is necessary; for I subsequently
failed in producing the same effect, owing,
no doubt, to having employed too strong an acid.</p>

<p>Let us return from this digression to the subject
of Sir Humphry Davy's Protectors. It only remains
for me to relate the results which followed
the practical application of the Voltaic principles
which his various experiments had developed.</p>

<p>In the month of May 1824, directions were issued
by the Lords of the Admiralty to protect, in future,
the copper sheathing of all his Majesty's ships which
might be taken into dock, upon the plan proposed
by Sir Humphry Davy.</p>

<p>The protectors were bars of iron six inches wide
at their base, three inches in thickness in their centre,
and, in outward form, the segment of an extended
circle. They were usually placed on each
side of the ship in a horizontal position, viz. in
midships about three feet under water&mdash;on the keel
in a line with these&mdash;and the remainder in the fore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
and afterparts of the ship (about three feet under
the line of fluitation), as far forward and abaft as the
curvatures of their respective bodies would allow of
their lying flat upon the surface of the copper.</p>

<p>As it is difficult by verbal description alone to
convey a sufficiently distinct idea of this subject to
persons unacquainted with naval architecture, I
have introduced a sketch, exhibiting the <em>general</em>
position of the <em>Protectors</em>, although they are necessarily
exaggerated in size, or they would have appeared
as mere specks upon the drawing.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img class="mw" src="images/i_272.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p>A. A. Line of Fluitation.</p>
</div></div>

<p>On several ships, some of the protectors, in the
stem and the stern, were placed <em>vertically</em>; in which
case they were fastened to the stems and stern-posts;
and in this manner they were found to act more
powerfully in preserving the copper, than when they
were all placed horizontally. The ends of the protectors
were rounded, in order to prevent any great
resistance to the water, and they were fastened to
the bottoms of the ships with copper bolts, the iron
being counter-sunk to receive their heads, and the
holes were then filled with carbonate of lime, or
Parker's cement. To bring about the best possible
contact of all the copper sheets, their edges, which
lap over each other, where the nails are driven to
fasten them to the ships, were rubbed bright, first
with sand-paper, and finally with glass-paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
Shortly after the ships thus protected were sent
to sea, it was evident to all on board, from their dull
sailing, that the bottoms had become very foul; and
on being examined in dry docks, it was found that
the copper was completely covered with sea-weed,
shell-fish of various kinds, and myriads of small
marine insects. Upon their removal, however, it
was found, on weighing the sheets, that the copper
had suffered little or no loss; thus proving that,
although its practical application had failed from
unforeseen circumstances, the principle of protection
was true, and had fully justified the expectation of
its success.</p>

<p>The copper near the protectors was much more
foul than that at a greater distance from them; and
there was, moreover, a considerable deposit of carbonate
of lime, and of carbonate and hydrate of
magnesia, in their vicinity.</p>

<p>Sir Humphry Davy immediately suggested, as a
remedy for this evil, that the bottoms should be
scraped, and the copper washed with a small quantity
of acidulous water; and he also proposed that
the protectors should in future be placed under,
instead of over, the copper sheathing. This plan
was immediately adopted. Discs of cast-iron three
and a half inches in diameter, and one-fourth of an
inch in thickness, were let into the plank of the
bottom of the Glasgow, of fifty guns, on the starboard
side only&mdash;the larboard side having been left
without any protection. These discs were in the
proportion of one to every four sheets of copper, and
over them were placed pieces of brown paper, and
over the paper thin sheet-lead, so that the latter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
metal was in contact with the copper sheathing. A
similar experiment was also tried on the Zebra, of
eighteen guns, substituting, however, discs of zinc<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
for those of iron.</p>

<p>The bottom of the Glasgow was examined twelve
months afterwards, when the discs of iron were
found oxidated throughout, presenting in their
appearance the characters of plumbago. The copper
on the starboard side was preserved, but covered
with weeds and shell-fish. The sheets on
the larboard had undergone the usual waste, but
were clean.</p>

<p>The Zebra was docked four years after the experiment
had commenced, when the zinc protectors
were perfect, and it did not appear that they had
exerted any influence in preserving the copper, as it
had wasted equally on both sides. It may be presumed
in this case that the Voltaic circuit had by
some fault in the arrangement been interrupted.</p>

<p>The apparent conversion of iron into a substance
resembling plumbago, by the action of sea-water,
has been frequently noticed. The protectors thus
changed<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> were, to a considerable depth from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
surface, so soft as to be easily cut by a knife; but
after being exposed for some time to the action of
the atmosphere, they became harder, and even brittle.
A portion of this soft substance having been
wrapped in paper for the purpose of examination,
and placed in the pocket of a shipwright, gave rise
to a very curious and unexpected result: at first, the
artist, like Futitorious with his chestnuts, thought
he perceived a genial warmth; but the effect was
shortly less equivocal; the substance became hot,
and presently passed into a state of absolute ignition.
Various theories have been suggested for its explanation:
Mr. Daniell has advanced an opinion which
supposes the formation of silicon, and thus accounts
for the spontaneous ignition by the action of air.</p>

<p>The disadvantages which arise from the foulness
of ships' bottoms, particularly when on foreign stations,
where there are no dry docks to receive them,
are so serious, that the Government was obliged, in
July 1825, to order the discontinuance of the protectors
on all sea-going ships; but directed that
they should still be used upon all those that were
laid up in our ports. When, however, an examination
of the latter took place, they were found to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
be much more foul than those which had been in
motion at sea: shell-fish of various kinds had adhered
to them so closely, that it was even necessary
to use percussion to remove them, which not only
indented the copper, but in many instances actually
fractured it.</p>

<p>Under all these discouraging circumstances, the
unwelcome conviction was forced upon the agents
of Government, that the plan was incapable of successful
application, and it was accordingly altogether
abandoned in September 1828.</p>

<p>Such were the results of the experiments carried
on in the ports of England, for the protection of
copper sheathing, from the success of which Sir H.
Davy justly expected honours, fame, and reward.
That his disappointment was great, may be readily
imagined, and it is supposed to have had a marked
influence upon his future character. It is much to
be regretted that his vexation should have been
heightened by the unjust and bitter attacks made
upon him by the periodical press, and by those subalterns
in science, who, unable to appreciate the
beauty of the principle he had so ably developed,
saw only in its details an object for sarcasm, and in
its failure an opportunity for censure; while those
whose stations should have implied superior knowledge,
in the pride and arrogance of assumed contempt,
sought a refuge from the humiliation of
ignorance.</p>

<p>That Davy was severely hurt by these attacks, is
a fact well known to his friends. In a letter to Mr.
Children he says: "A mind of much sensibility
might be disgusted, and one might be induced to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
say, Why should I labour for public objects, merely
to meet abuse?&mdash;I am irritated by them more than
I ought to be; but I am getting wiser every day&mdash;recollecting
Galileo, and the times when philosophers
and public benefactors were burnt for their
services." In another letter he alludes to the
sycophancy of a chemical journal, which, after the
grossest abuse, suddenly turned round, and disgusted
him with its adulation. "I never shake
hands," says he, "with chimney sweepers, even when
in their May-day clothes, and when they call me
'<em>Your honour</em>.'"</p>

<p>While the trials above related were proceeding
in the ports of England, the naval department of
France was prosecuting a similar enquiry; and as experiments
of this nature are conducted with greater
care, and examined with superior science, in that
country, it may not be uninteresting to the English
reader to receive a detail of the examination of the
bottom of La Constance frigate, in which the protectors
bore a much larger proportion to the copper
surface than was ever practised in the British navy.
This document, I may observe, is now published for
the first time.</p>

<p>"The inspection of the bottom of the frigate La
Constance, has given rise to some interesting observations
on the effect of protectors, and it has confirmed
the fact before advanced of the great inconvenience
which attends the application of too large
a proportion of the protecting metal.</p>

<p>"The surface of this metal, which was of cast
iron, placed on each side of the keel, and in long
scarphs of iron plates situated towards the stem and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
stern-post and the water line, appeared to have been
about the 1-30th part of the surface of the copper,
instead of the 1-250th part as now practised.</p>

<p>"The galvanic action has been extreme, both in
rapidity and intensity. The scarphs are entirely
destroyed, and have absolutely disappeared; and we
should have been ignorant of their having ever existed,
had we not been informed of the fact, and observed
dark stains which marked their position, and
discovered the nails still entire by which they had
been fastened.</p>

<p>"The plates, which were in the first instance
about three inches thick, were covered throughout
their whole length by a thick, unequal coating,
spotted with yellow oxide. This was principally
owing to the absorption of about twenty-five per
cent. of its weight of water. Under this, the iron
was as soft as plumbago, and there remained scarcely
an inch of metal of its original metallic hardness.</p>

<p>"The bulky and irregular appendage (the protectors)
at the lower part of the ship's bottom caused
a great noise in the sea, in consequence of the dead
water which it occasioned, and doubtless lessened
the speed of the vessel. But that which contributed
most to this unfortunate result, was the exceedingly
unclean state of the copper, arising from the
excess of the iron employed: this, carried to so great
an extent, having the effect of extracting matter
from the water, which, forming a concretion on the

<p>"Below, the copper was certainly preserved from
oxidation; and up to within a few sheets of the
water line, it did not appear to be worn. But to
save expense, it was obliged to be cleansed without
removal, by rubbing it hard with bricks and wet
sand, which has succeeded very well in restoring
its copper colour."</p>

(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ostrea cochlear</i>,) their shell rather fragile, almost
without lamellæ; upper valve concave, colour rather
deep violet, form variable.</p>

<p>"Besides these three kinds of Molluscæ, of which
the number was considerable, several species of calcareous
polypi were found; but those which could
be obtained were too imperfect to allow of their
being correctly described.</p>

<p>"The iron which was used to protect the copper
on the bottom of the Constance frigate having been
subjected to chemical analysis, the following are the
results.</p>

<p>"This iron, which was in small fragments, very
friable, little attracted by the loadstone, soft to the
touch, and soiling the fingers like plumbago, gave
out in rubbing it a very strong smell, very much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
like that of burnt linseed oil. Its colour on the
exterior was a brownish yellow, and its interior a
blackish grey, studded with little points extremely
brilliant.</p>

<p>"A short time after they had been taken from
the keel of the frigate, where they were covered
with a layer of hydrated peroxide of iron, of six or
eight lines in thickness, and been enclosed in a
paper box, these fragments became strongly heated,
and underwent a real combustion by means of the
oxygen of the atmosphere; the combustion was
accompanied by the production of a certain quantity
of aqueous vapour.</p>

<p>"In order to ascertain whether this elevation of
temperature was really alone owing to the absorption
of the oxygen, a case containing twelve <em>grammes</em> of
this iron was placed under a receiver, which contained
two hundred millimetres, inverted over a
tube of mercury; and it was observed, in the course
of an hour, that this air had diminished by forty
millimetres, or one-fifth of its volume. Examining
afterwards that which remained in the receiver, it
was discovered that it had no effect whatever either
on lime-water or the tincture of <em>tournesol</em>,&mdash;that it
was not inflammable,&mdash;that it extinguished a candle;
in a word, that it presented all the negative
qualities of azotic gas, strongly infected with the
smell before stated.</p>

<p>"It must be evident that the oxygen which was
absorbed in this experiment was employed solely in
burning the iron, which was already in a state of
<em>protoxide</em>, as was indicated by its little degree of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
cohesion, by the avidity with which it seized this
principle, and by its dissolving in sulphuric acid,
which operated without effervescence, and without
disengaging hydrogen gas.</p>

<p>"Five <em>grammes</em> of this oxidized iron being reduced
to an impalpable powder, and then made red-hot
in a platina crucible, and mixed with three parts
of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">potasse à l'alcool</i>, were reduced to a clammy mass,
coloured on its edges with a clear beautiful green,
and with a greenish yellow on the other parts;
which at once indicated the presence of a small
portion of manganese, and that of a little <em>chrôme</em>;
metals which are found united in almost all sorts
of iron. Treated in the usual way, this mass
exhibited&mdash;</p>

<p>"First, Traces, scarcely sensible, of these two
metals.</p>

<p>"Secondly, One <em>gramme</em> of brilliant black powder,
soft to the touch, staining paper, insoluble in
muriatic acid when applied boiling: it was therefore
a true percarburet of iron.</p>

<p>"Thirdly, Three <em>grammes</em> and ten <em>decigrammes</em> of
peroxide of iron.</p>

<p>"On being subjected to the action of boiling
water, five grammes of this pulverized iron gave
out three <em>decigrammes</em> of soluble matter, composed,
for the greater part, of <em>hydrochlorate</em> of iron, and a
trace of hydrochlorate of magnesia, together with a
little organic matter, the combination of which with
the iron will account for the insufferable smell which
it gave out when the iron was heated. This saline
solution sensibly reddened the litmus paper: an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
effect which was owing to the muriatic acid, which,
in uniting with oxidized iron, and with most other
metallic oxides, never forms combinations which are
perfectly neutral, but which are always more or less
acid.</p>

<p>"It has in vain been attempted to discover in
this oxidized iron the presence of silex, of alumina,
and of the sulphuric and carbonic acids, either free,
or in combination.</p>

<p>"It results from this analysis, that the fragments
of the protectors, which have been the object of it,
are composed, in a hundred parts, of about</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="2" summary="table">
<tr>

  <td>&nbsp;</td>
  <td>of water; as in fragments pulverised and
heated for half an hour at a temperature of
100°, they lost 1-10th of their weight.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>"As to the reddish yellow matter, with small
protuberances like nipples, which formed a thick
layer on the surface of the protectors, it was formed
of 75 parts of oxide of iron at the most, and 25
parts of water, besides some atoms of hydrochlorate
of iron, hydrochlorate of soda, and hydrochlorate of
magnesia."</p>

<p>Had not the health of Davy unfortunately declined
at the very period when his energies were
most required, such is the unbounded confidence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
which all must feel in his unrivalled powers of vanquishing
practical difficulties, and of removing the
obstacles which so constantly thwart the applications
of theory, that little doubt can be entertained
but he would soon have discovered some plan by
which the adhesion of marine bodies to the copper
sheathing might have been prevented, and his principle
of Voltaic protection thus rendered available.
An experiment indeed, altogether founded upon
this same principle, has been already proposed, and
will be shortly tried in the British navy, by building
a schooner, and fastening its materials together
with copper bolts, and afterwards sheathing the
bottom with thin plates of iron, which are to be
protected by bands of zinc. At the same time,
another schooner is to be built, in which the fastenings
are to consist entirely of iron bolts and nails,
the former to be protected by a zinc ring under
each head or clench, and the latter to have a small
piece of zinc soldered under its head.</p>

<p>This plan of protection was first adopted in America,
at the recommendation of Dr. Revere; and
upon its successful issue, that gentleman was lately
induced to take out letters patent not only in England,
but in all the maritime countries of Europe,
for the sole right of manufacturing iron sheathing,
bolts, and nails, thus protected.</p>

<p>As no doubt now exists as to the principle of the
protection of iron by zinc, the bolts and nails may
be expected to remain free from rust as long as the
more oxidable metal lasts; but with regard to the
success of the iron sheathing, it is impossible to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
entertain the same confidence; for what, in this
case, is to prevent the adhesion of shell-fish and
sea-weed upon its surface? Let it be remembered,
that it is only when the copper is in the act of
solution in sea-water that the sheathing remains
clean. In the year 1829, the Tender to the Flagship
at Plymouth had her copper on one side of the
bottom painted with white lead: in six months,
this side was covered with long weeds; while the
other side, which had been left bright, and consequently
exposed to the solvent action of the salt-water,
was found entirely free from all such adhesions.</p>

<p>The friends of Sir Humphry Davy saw with extreme
regret that the failure of his plan for protecting
copper sheathing had produced in his mind
a degree of disappointment and chagrin wholly inconsistent
with the merits of the question; that
while he became insensible to the voice of praise,
every nerve was jarred by the slightest note of disapprobation.
I apprehend, however, that the change
of character which many ascribed to the mortification
of wounded pride, ought in some measure
to be referred to a declining state of bodily power,
which had brought with it its usual infirmities of
petulance and despondency. The letters I shall
here introduce may perhaps be considered as indicating
that instinctive desire for quiet and retirement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
which frequently marks a declining state of
health, and they will be followed by others of a less

<p class="opening">MY DEAR POOLE,</p>

<p>It is very long since I have heard from you,
Mr. A&mdash;&mdash;, whom you introduced to me, has sometimes
given me news of you, and I have always
heard of your health and well-being with pleasure.</p>

<p>My immediate motive for writing to you now is
somewhat, though not entirely selfish. You know
1 have always admired your neighbourhood, and
I have lately seen a place advertised there, called, I
think,&mdash;&mdash;, not far from Quantock, and combining,
as far as advertisement can be trusted, scenery,
fishing, shooting, interest for money, &amp;c.</p>

<p>If it is not sold, pray give me a little idea of it;
I have long been looking out for a purchase,&mdash;perhaps
this may suit me. After all, it may be
sold; if so, no harm is done.</p>

<p>I go on labouring for utility, perhaps more than
for glory; caring something for the judgment of
my contemporaries, but more for that of posterity;
and confiding with boldness in the solid judgment
of Time.</p>

<p>I have lately seen some magnificent country in
the Scandinavian peninsula, where Nature, if not a
kind, is at least a beautiful mother.&mdash;I wonder there
have not been more poets in the North.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR POOLE,</p>

<p>My proposition to come into Somersetshire about
the 10th was founded upon two visits which I had
to pay in this county, Hants; I am now only about
sixty miles from you; and had you been at home,
I should have come on to Nether Stowey. The
13th is the first meeting of the Royal Society after
the holidays; and though I might do my duty by
deputy, yet I feel that this would not be right, and
I will not have the honour of the chair without
conscientiously taking the labours which its possession
entails. I regret therefore that I cannot be

<p>I had a letter a few days ago from C&mdash;&mdash;, who
writes in good spirits, and who, being within a few
miles of London, might, as far as his friends are
concerned, be at John a Grot's house. He writes
with all his ancient power. I had hoped that, as his
mind became subdued, and his imagination less
vivid, he might have been able to apply himself to
persevere, and to give to the world some of those
trains of thought, so original, so impressive, and at
which we have so often wondered.</p>

<p>I am writing this letter at a meeting of the Trustees
of the British Museum, which will account for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
its want of correction. Lest I should be more desultory,

<p class="center">TO THE SAME.</p>

<p class="date">Feb. 28, 1825.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR POOLE,</p>

<p>I am very much obliged to you for your two
letters, which I received in proper time. I have deferred
writing, in the hopes that I might be able to
pay you a visit and see the property, but I now
find this will be impossible. I have a cold, which
has taken a stronger and more inflammable character
than usual, which obliges me to lay myself up; and
in this weather it would be worse than imprudent
to travel.</p>

<p>I have seen Mr. Z&mdash;&mdash;, and can perfectly re-echo
your favourable sentiments respecting him. I saw
the plan of the estate, and heard every thing he
had to say respecting the value, real and imaginary,
of the lands. He certainly hopes at this moment
for a fancy price, and he is right if he can get it.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>I have less fancy for the place, from finding the
trout-stream a brook in summer, where salmon-trout,
or salmon, could not be propagated; for one
of my favourite ideas in a country residence is varied
and multiplied experiments on the increase and propagation
of fish.</p>

<p>What I should really like would be a place with
a couple of hundred acres of productive land, and
plenty of moor, a river running through it, and the
sea before it; and not farther from London than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
Hampshire&mdash;a day's journey. There are such places
along the coast, though perhaps in my lifetime they
will not be disposed of. I should also like to be
within a few miles of you; for it is one of the
regrets in the life which I lead, that devotion to the
cause of science separates me very much from
friends that I shall ever venerate and esteem. God
bless you, my dear Poole,</p>

you at home, and quite well.</p>

<p>Mr. T&mdash;&mdash;, who is here, gives me a very good

able to verify.</p>

<p>If you are at leisure, I will try to shoot a few
woodcocks on Monday on the Quantock hills; on

<p>I have not been well lately. I cannot take the
exercise which twenty years ago I went lightly and
agreeably through. Will you have the kindness
to hire a pony for me, that I may ride to your
hills?</p>

<p>I am sorry I did not know of your journey to
Ireland and Scotland. I was in both those countries
at the time you visited them, and should have been
delighted to have met you.</p>

<p>Do not write to me; for, even if you should not

</div>

<p>The complaints, as to the loss of his strength,
which are expressed in the preceding letter, were
but too well founded. Mr. Poole informs me that,
during this visit in 1826, it was affecting to observe
the efforts he made to continue his field sports.
From being unable to walk without fatigue, he was
compelled to have a pony to take him to the field,
from which he dismounted only on the certainty of
immediate sport.</p>

<p>On his return to London, his indisposition increased:
he complained to me of palpitation of the
heart, and of an affection in the trachea, which led
him to fear that he might be suffering under the
disease of which his father died.</p>

<p>The fatigue attendant upon the duties of the
anniversary of the Royal Society (November 30th)
completely exhausted him; and after his re-election
as President, he was reluctantly obliged to retire,
and to decline attending the usual dinner upon that
occasion.</p>

<p>In January 1827, Sir Humphry Davy published
the Discourses which he had delivered before the
Royal Society, at six successive anniversary meetings,
on the award of the Royal and Copley medals.
They were published in compliance with a resolution
of a meeting of the Council, held on the 21st
of December 1826.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
The practice of delivering an annual oration before
the Royal Society, on the occasion of presenting
the medal upon Sir Godfrey Copley's donation,
prevailed during the presidency of Sir John Pringle;
it was, however, during a long interval discontinued,
and only revived during the latter years of
Sir Joseph Banks.</p>

<p>The discourse usually commenced with a short
tribute of respect to the memory of those distinguished
Fellows who had died since the preceding
anniversary. It then proceeded to announce the
choice of the Council in its award of the medals,
enumerating the objects and merits of the several
communications which had been honoured with so
distinguished a mark of approbation, and stating
the circumstances which had directed the judges in
their decision.</p>

<p>Much has been said and written upon the inutility,
and even upon the mischievous tendency of
this practice; and great stress has been laid upon
the vices inseparably connected, as it is asserted,
with the style of composition to which it gives
origin. It appears to me, however, that it is only
against the meretricious execution, not against the
temperate use of such discourses, that this charge
can be fairly and consistently sustained; and in the
chaste and yet powerful addresses of Davy, such an
opinion will find its best sanction, and obtain its
strongest support.</p>

<p>Does it follow, because praise, when unduly lavished
upon the labours of the scientific dead, may
create comparisons and preferences injurious to the
living, that we are to stifle the noblest aspirations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
our nature, and become as cold and silent as the
grave that encloses their remains? Does it follow,
because an undisciplined ardour may have occasionally
exaggerated the merits of our contemporaries,
that we are henceforth to withhold from them
a just tribute of applause at their discoveries&mdash;to
forego the advantages which science must derive
from a plan so well calculated to awaken the flagging
attention, to infuse into stagnant research a
renewed spirit of animation, and to encourage the
industry of the labourer in the abstract regions of
science, with prospects gleaming with sunshine,
and luxuriant in the fruitfulness which is to reward
him?</p>

<p>Such was the character, such the effect of Davy's
discourses. They exhibit a great assemblage of diversified
talents, and display the refined views he
entertained with respect to the mutual relations
which the different sciences maintain with each
other; they evince, moreover, a great command of
language, and a power to give exact expression to
what his mind had conceived.</p>

<p>To these six Discourses is prefixed his Address
upon taking the chair of the Royal Society for the
first time; the subject of which is "The present
state of that Body, and the Progress and Prospects
of Science." Upon this occasion, he particularly
adverts to the light which the different branches
of science may reflect upon each other. "In pure
Mathematics&mdash;though their nature, as a work of
intellectual combination, framed by the highest
efforts of human intelligence, renders them incapable
of receiving aids from observations of external
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
phenomena, or the invention of new instruments,
yet they are, at this moment, abundant in
the promise of new applications; and many of the
departments of philosophical enquiry which appeared
formerly to bear no relation to quantity, weight,
figure, or number, as I shall more particularly mention
hereafter, are now brought under the dominion
of that sublime science, which is, as it were, the
animating principle of all the other sciences."</p>

<p>"In the theory of light and vision, the researches
of Huygens, Newton, and Wollaston, have been
followed by those of Malus; and the phenomena
of polarization are constantly tending to new discoveries;
and it is extremely probable that those
beautiful results will lead to a more profound
knowledge than has hitherto been obtained, concerning
the intimate constitution of bodies, and
establish a near connexion between mechanical and
chemical philosophy."</p>

<p>"The subject of heat, so nearly allied to that of
light, has lately afforded a rich harvest of discovery;
yet it is fertile in unexplored phenomena. The
question of the materiality of heat will probably be
solved at the same time as that of the undulating
hypothesis of light, if, indeed, the human mind
should ever be capable of understanding the causes
of these mysterious phenomena. The applications
of the doctrine of heat to the atomic or corpuscular
philosophy of chemistry abound in new views, and
probably at no very distant period these views will
assume a precise mathematical form."</p>

<p>"In Electricity, the wonderful instrument of
Volta has done more for the obscure parts of physics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
and chemistry, than the microscope ever effected
for natural history, or even the telescope for
astronomy. After presenting to us the most extraordinary
and unexpected results in chemical analysis,
it is now throwing a new light upon magnetism.</p>

<p class="center small">'Suppeditatque novo confestim lumine lumen.'</p>

<p>"I must congratulate the Society on the rapid
progress made in the theory of definite proportions,
since it was advanced in a distinct form by the ingenuity
of Mr. Dalton. I congratulate the Society
on the promise it affords of solving the recondite
changes, owing to motions of the particles of matter,
by laws depending upon their weight, number,
and figure, and which will be probably found as
simple in their origin, and as harmonious in their
relations, as those which direct the motions of the
heavenly bodies, and produce the beauty and order
of the celestial systems.</p>

<p>"The crystallizations, or regular forms of inorganic
matter, are intimately connected with definite
proportions, and depend upon the nature of
the combinations of the elementary particles; and
both the laws of electrical polarity, and the polarization
of light, seem related to these phenomena.
As to the origin of the primary arrangement of the
crystalline matter of the globe, various hypotheses
have been applied, and the question is still agitated,
and is perhaps above the present state of our knowledge;
but there are two principal facts which present
analogies on the subject,&mdash;one, that the form
of the earth is that which would result, supposing
it to have been originally fluid; and the other, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
in lavas, masses decidedly of igneous origin, crystalline
substances, similar to those belonging to the
primary rocks, are found in abundance."</p>

<p>It is the privilege of genius to be in advance of
the age, and to see, "as by refraction, the light, as
yet below the horizon." It is with such a feeling
that I have introduced the foregoing extracts, which
I cannot but regard as prophetic of future discoveries.</p>

<p>The first discourse was delivered on the 30th of
November 1821, on the occasion of announcing the
award of two medals, on Sir Godfrey Copley's donation;
one to J. F. W. Herschel, Esq. for his various
papers on mathematical and physico-mathematical
subjects; and the other, to Captain Edward
Sabine, R.A., for his papers containing an account
of his various experiments and observations made
during a voyage and expedition in the Arctic regions.</p>

<p>As I am desirous that the reader should be made
acquainted with the nature and style of the address
with which he accompanied the presentation of the
medal, I cannot select a happier example, or one in
the sentiments of which every person will more
readily participate, than the following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Herschel</span>&mdash;Receive this medal, Sir, as a
mark of our respect, and of our admiration of those
talents which you have applied with so much zeal
and success, and preserve it as a pledge of future
exertions in the cause of Science and of the Royal
Society; and, believe me, you can communicate
your labours to no public body by whom they will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
be better received, or through whose records they
will be better known to the philosophical world.
You are in the prime of life, in the beginning of
your career, and you have powers and acquirements
capable of illustrating and extending every branch
of physical enquiry; and, in the field of science,
how many are the spots not yet cultivated! Where
the laws of sensible become connected with those
of insensible motions, the mechanical with the chemical
phenomena, how little is known! In electricity,
magnetism, in the relations of crystallized
forms to the weight of the elements of bodies, what
a number of curious and important objects of research!
and they are objects which you are peculiarly
qualified to pursue and illustrate.</p>

<p>"May you continue to devote yourself to philosophical
pursuits, and to exalt your reputation,
already so high&mdash;</p>

<p class="center small">'Virtutem extendere factis.'</p>

<p>And these pursuits you will find not only glorious,
but dignified, useful, and gratifying in every period
of life: this, indeed, you must know best in the
example of your illustrious father, who, full of
years and of honours, must view your exertions
with infinite pleasure; and who, in the hopes that
his own imperishable name will be permanently
connected with yours in the annals of philosophy,
must look forward to a double immortality."</p>

</div>

<p>In the discourse of the succeeding year, it was
his painful duty to announce the death of the elder
Herschel, whom, in his former address, he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
eulogized in such eloquent and touching language.</p>

<p>In alluding to the labours and discoveries of Sir
William Herschel, he observed, that "they have so
much contributed to the progress of modern astronomy,
that his name will probably live as long as
the inhabitants of this earth are permitted to view
the solar system, or to understand the laws of its
motions. The world of science&mdash;the civilized world,
are alike indebted to him who enlarges the boundaries
of human knowledge, who increases the scope
of intellectual enjoyment, and exhibits the human
mind in possession of new and unknown powers,
by which it gains, as it were, new dominions in
space; acquisitions which are imperishable&mdash;not
like the boundaries of terrestrial states and kingdoms,
or even the great monuments of art, which,
however extensive and splendid, must decay&mdash;but
secured by the grandest forms and objects of nature,
and registered amongst her laws."</p>

<p>One more quotation, and I shall conclude with
the conviction that the splendid specimens I have
adduced must fully justify the opinion already
offered as to the taste, power, and eloquence with
which, as President of the Royal Society, he discharged
the most delicate and arduous of all its
duties.</p>

<p>In his address to Mr. (now Dr.) Buckland, on
delivering to him the medal for his important memoir
on the fossile remains discovered in the cave
near Kirkdale, he thus concludes:&mdash;"If we look
with wonder upon the great remains of human
works, such as the columns of Palmyra, broken in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
the midst of the desert; the temples of Pæstum,
beautiful in the decay of twenty centuries; or the
mutilated fragments of Greek sculpture in the
Acropolis of Athens, or in our own Museum, as
proofs of the genius of artists, and power and riches
of nations now past away; with how much deeper
a feeling of admiration must we consider those
grand monuments of nature which mark the revolutions
of the globe&mdash;continents broken into islands;
one land produced, another destroyed; the bottom
of the ocean become a fertile soil; whole races of
animals extinct, and the bones and exuviæ of one
class covered with the remains of another; and
upon these graves of past generations&mdash;the marble
or rocky tombs, as it were, of a former animated
world, new generations rising, and order and harmony
established, and a system of life and beauty
produced, as it were, out of chaos and death, proving
the infinite power, wisdom, and goodness of the
Great Cause of all being!"</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>I have noticed the apparent commencement of
that general indisposition which had for some time
been stealing upon him, undermining his powers,
oppressing his spirits, and subduing his best energies;
but in the end of 1826, his complaint assumed
a more decided and alarming form. Feeling more
than usually unwell, while on a visit to his friend
Lord Gage, he determined to return to London,
and was seized while on his journey, at Mayersfield,
with an apoplectic attack. Prompt and copious
bleeding, however, on the spot, arrested the symptoms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
more immediately threatening the extinction
of life, and enabled him to reach home; but paralysis,
the usual consequence of such seizures, had
obviously, though at first but slightly, diminished
his muscular powers, and given an awkwardness to
his gait.</p>

<p>As soon as the more immediate danger of the
attack had passed away, it was thought expedient
to recommend, as the best means of his farther recovery,
a residence in the southern part of Europe,
where he would be removed from all the cares and
anxieties that were inseparably connected with his
continuance in London; and he accordingly quitted
England, with the intention of spending what remained
of the winter in Italy.</p>

<p>The following interesting letter to his friend will
sufficiently explain the serious character of his malady,
and the degree of bodily infirmity which accompanied
it.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO THOMAS POOLE, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">Ravenna, March 14, 1827.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR POOLE,</p>

<p>I should have answered your letter immediately,
had it been possible; but I was, at the time I received
it, very ill, in the crisis of the complaint
under which I have long suffered, and which turned
out to be a determination of the blood to the brain;
at last producing the most alarming nervous symptoms,
and threatening the loss of power and of life.</p>

<p>Had I been in England, I should gladly have
promoted the election of your friend at the Athenæum:
your certificate of character would always
be enough for me; for, like our angling evangelical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
Isaac Walton, I know you choose for your friends
only good men.</p>

<p>I am, thank God, better, but still very weak, and
wholly unfit for any kind of business and study. I
have, however, considerably recovered the use of all
the limbs that were affected; and as my amendment
has been slow and gradual, I hope in time it may be
complete: but I am leading the life of an anchorite,
obliged to abstain from flesh, wine, business, study,
experiments, and all things that I love; but this
discipline is salutary, and for the sake of being
able to do something more for science, and, I hope,
for humanity, I submit to it; believing that the
Great Source of intellectual being so wills it for
good.</p>

<p>I am here lodged in the Apostolical Palace, by
the kindness of the Vice-Legate of Ravenna, a most
admirable and enlightened prelate, and who has done
every thing for me that he could have done for a
brother.</p>

<p>I have chosen this spot of the declining empire of
Rome, as one of solitude and repose, as out of the
way of travellers, and in a good climate; and its
monuments and recollections are not without interest.
Here Dante composed his divine works.
Here Byron wrote some of his best and most moral
(if such a name can be applied) poems; and here the
Roman power that began among the mountains
with Romulus, and migrated to the sea, bounding
Asia and Europe under Constantine, made its last
stand, in the marshes formed by the Eridanus, under
Theodorick, whose tomb is amongst the wonders of
the place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
After a month's travel in the most severe weather
I ever experienced, I arrived here on the 20th of
February. The weather has since been fine. My
brother and friend, who is likewise my physician,
accompanied me; but he is so satisfied with my improvement,
as to be able to leave me for Corfu; but
he is within a week's call.</p>

<p>I have no society here, except that of the amiable
Vice-Legate, who is the Governor of the Province;
but this is enough for me, for as yet I can bear but
little conversation. I ride in the pine forest, which
is the most magnificent in Europe, and which I wish
you could see. You know the trees by Claude
Lorraine's landscapes: imagine a circle of twenty
miles of these great fan-shaped pines, green sunny
lawns, and little knolls of underwood, with large
junipers of the Adriatic in front, and the Apennines
still covered with snow behind. The pine wood
partly covers the spot where the Roman fleet once
rode,&mdash;such is the change of time!</p>

<p>It is my intention to stay here till the beginning
of April, and then to go to the Alps, for I must
avoid the extremes of heat and cold.</p>

<p>God bless you, my dear Poole. I am always your
old and sincere friend,</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">H. Davy</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>Feeling that his recovery was tardy, and that perfect
mental repose was more than ever necessary for
its advancement, he determined to resign the chair
of the Royal Society; and he accordingly announced
that intention, by a letter to his friend Mr. Davies
Gilbert, Vice-President of the Society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO DAVIES GILBERT, ESQ. M.P. V.P.R.S. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p class="date">Salzburgh, July 1, 1827.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR SIR,</p>

<p>Yesterday, on my arrival here, I found your
two letters. I am sorry I did not receive the one
you were so good as to address to me at Ravenna;
nor can I account for its miscarriage. I commissioned
a friend there to transmit to me my letters
from that place after my departure, and I received
several, even so late as the middle of May, at Laybach,
which had been sent to Italy, and afterwards
to Illyria. I did not write to you again, because I
always entertained hopes of being able to give a
better account of the state of my health. I am
sorry to say the expectations of my physicians of a
complete and rapid recovery have not been realized.
I have gained ground, under the most favourable
circumstances, very slowly; and though I have had
no new attack, and have regained, to a certain extent,
the use of my limbs, yet the tendency of the
system to accumulate blood in the head still continues,
and I am obliged to counteract it by a most
rigid vegetable diet, and by frequent bleedings with
leeches and blisterings, which of course keep me very
low. From my youth up to last year, I had suffered,
more or less, from a slight hemorrhoidal affection;
and the fulness of the vessels, then only a
slight inconvenience, becomes a serious and dangerous
evil in the head, to which it seems to have
been transferred. I am far from despairing of an
ultimate recovery, but it must be a work of time,
and the vessels which have been over distended only
very slowly regain their former dimensions and tone:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
and for my recovery, not only diet and regimen and
physical discipline, but a freedom from anxiety, and
from all business and all intellectual exertion, is
absolutely required.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, I feel it would be
highly imprudent and perhaps fatal for me, to return,
and to attempt to perform the official duties of
President of the Royal Society. And as I had no
other feeling for that high and honourable situation,
except the hope of being useful to society, so I
would not keep it a moment without the security of
being able to devote myself to the labour and attention
it demands. I beg therefore you will be so
good as to communicate my resignation to the Council
and to the Society at their first meeting in November,
after the long vacation; stating the circumstances
of my severe and long continued illness, as
the cause. At the same time, I beg you will express
to them how truly grateful I feel for the high
honour they have done me in placing me in the
chair for so many successive years. Assure them
that I shall always take the same interest in the
progress of the grand objects of the Society, and
throughout the whole of my life endeavour to contribute
to their advancement, and to the prosperity
of the body.</p>

<p>Should circumstances prevent me from sending,
or you from receiving any other communication
from me before the autumn (for nothing is more uncertain
than the post in Austria, as they take time
to read the letters), I hope this, which I shall go to
Bavaria to send, will reach you safe, and will be sufficient
to settle the affair of resignation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
It was my intention to have said nothing on the
subject of my successor. I will support by all the
means in my power the person that the leading
members of the Society shall place in the chair; but
I cannot resist an expression of satisfaction in the
hope you held out, that an illustrious friend of the
Society, illustrious from his talents, his former situation,
and, I may say, his late conduct, is likely to be
my successor.</p>

<p>I wish my name to be in the next Council, as I
shall certainly return, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Deo volente</i>, before the end of
the session, and I may, I think, be of use; and likewise,
because I hope it may be clearly understood
that my feelings for the Society are, as they always
were, those of warm attachment and respect. Writing
still makes my head ache, and raises my pulse.
I will therefore conclude, my dear Sir, in returning
you my sincere thanks for the trouble you have had
on my account, and assuring you that I am</p>

<p class="signature3">Your obliged and grateful friend and servant,<br />
<span class="smcap j10">H. Davy</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>Pray acknowledge the receipt of this letter, by
addressing me, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">poste restante</i>, Laybach, Illyria,
Austria;" and let me know if Mr. Hudson is still
Assistant-Secretary, and where Mr. South is. I
send this letter from Frauenstein, Bavaria, July 2,
that it may not be opened, as all my letters were at
Salzburgh. There was one of them must have
<em>amused</em> Prince Metternich, on the state of parties in
England, from a Member of the Upper House.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>In consequence of this letter, the Council of the
Royal Society, by a resolution passed at a very full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
meeting held on the 6th of November, 1827, appointed
Mr. Davies Gilbert to fill the chair, until
the general body should elect a President, at the
ensuing anniversary.</p>

<p>The following letter will show his subsequent
course of proceeding.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO THOMAS POOLE, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date2">Park Street, Grosvenor Square, Oct. 29, 1827.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR POOLE,</p>

<p>I hope you received a letter which I addressed to
you from Ravenna in the spring. It was my intention
to have returned to Italy from the Alpine
countries, where I spent the summer; but my recovery
has been so slow, and so much uneasiness in the
head and weakness in the limbs remained in September,
that I thought it wiser to return to my
medical advisers in London.</p>

<p>I have consulted all the celebrated men who have
written upon or studied the nervous system. They
all have a good opinion of my case, and they all
order absolute repose for at least twelve months
longer, and will not allow me to resume my scientific
duties or labours at present; and they insist
upon my leaving London for the next three or four
months, and advise a residence in the west of England.
Now, my dear friend, you recollect our conversation
upon the subject of a residence&mdash;I think
Mr. C.'s is not very far from you. Pray let me
know something on this head. I want very little of
any thing, for I am almost on a vegetable diet; and
a little horse exercise, a very little shooting, and a
little quiet society, are what I am in search of, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
some facilities of procuring books. I have thought
of Minehead, Ilfracombe, Lymouth, and Penzance;
but I have not yet determined the point.</p>

<p>Horse exercise and shooting are necessary to bring
back my limbs to their former state, and therefore
Bath and Brighton will not do for me. God bless
you, my dear Poole, and pray let me hear from
you.</p>

<p class="signature">Your affectionate,<br />
<span class="smcap j6">H. Davy</span>.</p>

<p>P.S. I hope you got the copy of my discourses.</p>

</div>

<hr class="c15" />

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO THE SAME.</p>

<p class="date">Firle, near Lewes, Nov. 4, 1827.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR POOLE,</p>

<p>I have this moment received your very kind
and most friendly letter. I have made my first visit
to my friend Lord G&mdash;&mdash;, where I was taken ill
last year; and have borne the journey well, and
have enjoyed the small society here; but I am very
weak indeed, and I cannot yet walk more than a
mile. One of three plans, I shall hope to adopt;
two of them you have most amiably suggested, the
other is to go to Penzance. My only objection to
the last is the fear of too much society. Whatever
I do, I will first come to you and take your advice.</p>

<p>When I returned, I had little hopes of recovery;
but the assurances of my physicians that I may
again, with care, be re-established, have revived me,
and I have certainly gained ground, and gained
strength, by the plan I am now pursuing.</p>

<p>As soon as I return to London, I will write to
you. If I can find a companion, I think Mr.
C&mdash;&mdash;'s house will do admirably; but I must see
it, as a temperate situation is a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine quâ non</i>.</p>

<p>I need not say how grateful I am for your kindness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
and if I recover, how delighted I shall be to
owe the means to so excellent and invaluable a
friend. God bless you.</p>

<p class="signature2">I am, my dear Poole, your affectionate,<br />
<span class="smcap j10">H. Davy</span>.</p>

</div>

<hr class="c15" />

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO THE SAME.</p>

<p class="date">Firle, Nov. 7.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR POOLE,</p>

<p>I am going to London to-morrow, and after
staying two or three days, to try a new plan of
medical treatment, which my physicians recommend,
I shall come westward, and profit by your kindness,
and adopt whichever of the plans will promise to be
most salutary.</p>

<p>If I take Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;'s house, Lady Davy will
come to me. With respect to society, I want only
a friend, or one person or two at most, to prevent
entire solitude, and I am too weak to bear much
conversation, and wholly unfit to receive any but
persons with whom I am in the habits of intimacy.</p>

<p>I can hardly express to you how deeply I feel
your kindness.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>As I must travel slowly, I shall not probably be
at Stowey before Wednesday or Thursday next.
Pray do not ask any body to meet me. I am upon
the <em>strictest</em> diet,&mdash;a wing of a chicken and a plain
rice or bread pudding is the extreme of my <em>gourmanderie</em>.
God bless you.</p>

<p class="signature">My dear Poole, your affectionate friend,<br />
<span class="smcap j10">H. Davy</span>.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
Mr. Poole has been so obliging as to communicate
to me some interesting particulars connected
with the visit to which the foregoing letters allude.</p>

<p>"During this last visit, (November and December
1827,) his bodily infirmity was very great, and his
sensibility was painfully alive on every occasion.
Unhappily, he had to sustain the affliction of the
sudden death of Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;, the son of a friend
whom he highly valued; and though this afflicting
event was, by the considerate and anxious attention
of Lady Davy, first communicated to me by letter,
to be imparted to him with every precaution, to
avoid his being suddenly shocked, yet it was many
days before he could recover his usual spirits, feeble
as they were, and resume his wonted occupation.</p>

<p>"On his arrival, he said, 'Here I am, the ruin of
what I was;' but nevertheless, the same activity
and ardour of mind continued, though directed to
different objects. He employed himself two or
three hours in the morning on his <em>Salmonia</em>, which
he was then writing; he would afterwards take a
short walk, which he accomplished with difficulty,
or ride. After dinner, I used to read to him some
amusing book. We were particularly interested
by Southey's Life of Nelson. 'It would give
Southey,' he said, 'great pleasure, if he knew how
much his narrative affected us.'<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>"In the evening, Mr. and Mrs. W&mdash;&mdash;, the former
of whom he had long known, frequently came to
make a rubber at whist. He was averse to seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
strangers; but on being shown the drawings of
Natural History of a friend of mine of great talent,
Mr. Baker of Bridgwater, he was anxious to know
him, and was much pleased with his company. He
suggested to him various subjects for investigation,
concerning insects, and fish, particularly the eel.
What pleasure would it give him were he now
alive, to learn the interesting result of those suggestions!
I hope the public will soon be made
acquainted with them.</p>

<p>"Natural History in general had been a favourite
subject with him throughout his protracted illness;
and during this last visit to me, he paid attention
to that only; 'for,' said he, 'I am prohibited
applying, and indeed I am incapable of applying,
to any thing which requires severe attention.'</p>

<p>"During the same visit, I remember his inherent
love of the laboratory, if I may so express myself,
being manifested in a manner which much interested
me at the moment. On his visiting with me
a gentleman in this neighbourhood, who had offered
him his house, and who has an extensive philosophical
apparatus, particularly complete in electricity
and chemistry, he was fatigued with the journey,
and as we were walking round the house very languidly,
a door opened, and we were in the laboratory.
He threw a glance around the room, his eyes
brightened in the action, a glow came over his countenance,
and he looked like himself, as he was
accustomed to appear twenty years ago.</p>

<p>"You are aware that he was latterly a good shot,
always an expert angler, and a great admirer of old
Isaac Walton; and that he highly prided himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
upon these accomplishments. I used to laugh at
him, which he did not like; but it amused me to
see such a man give so much importance to those
qualifications. He would say, 'It is not the sport
only, though there is great pleasure in successful
dexterity,<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> but it is the ardour of pursuit, pure air,
the contemplation of a fine country, and the exercise&mdash;all
tend to invigorate the body, and to excite
the mind to its best efforts.'</p>

<p>"These amusements seemed to become more and
more important in his estimation, as his health declined.
It was affecting to observe the efforts he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
made to continue them with diminished strength.
From being unable to walk without fatigue for
many hours, he was, when he came to me in November
1826, obliged to have a pony to carry him
to the field, from which he dismounted only on the
certainty of immediate sport. In the following
year, he could only take short and occasional rides
to the covers, with his dogs around him, and his
servant walking by his side and carrying his gun,
but which I believe he never fired.</p>

<p>"During this visit, he more than once observed,
'I do not wish to live, as far as I am personally concerned;
but I have views which I could develope,
if it pleased God to save my life, which would be
useful to science and to mankind.'"</p>

<p>Davy returned to town in December, and after
an interval wrote the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO THOMAS POOLE, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date2">Park Street, Grosvenor Square, Dec. 27, 1827.</p>

<p class="opening">MY VERY DEAR FRIEND,</p>

<p>I know no reason why I have not written to you.
It has been my intention every day, and I have
been every day prevented by the sense of want
of power, which is so painful a symptom of my
malady.</p>

<p>I continue much as I was. My physicians augur
well, and I have some repose in the hopes connected
with the indefinite future. In the last twelve-month,
which I hope is a large portion, on the
whole, of my purgatory expiation for crimes of commission
or omission, the most cheerful, or rather the
least miserable, days that I spent, were a good deal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
owing to your kindness, which I shall never forget.
I would, if it were possible, make my letter something
more than a mere bulletin of health, or the
expression of the feelings of a sick man; but I can
communicate no news. The papers will tell you
more than is true; and our politicians seem ignorant
of what they are to do at home, much more abroad.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>I have got for you a copy of my lectures on the
Chemistry of Agriculture, which I shall send to you
by the first opportunity. God bless you, my dear
Poole.</p>

<p class="signature">I am always your sincere,<br />
<span class="j2">Grateful, and affectionate friend,</span><br />
<span class="smcap j10">H. Davy</span>.</p>

<p>In the letter which follows, Davy dwells upon a
subject in Natural History, which appears to have
greatly occupied his thoughts, and to have continued
a predominant subject of his contemplation,
even to the latest day of his life.</p>

<p class="center">TO THOMAS POOLE, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">Park Street, January 1, 1828.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR FRIEND,</p>

<p>I write to you immediately, because that part of
your letter which relates to Mr. Baker's pursuits
interests me very much: but before I begin on this
subject, I will give you a short bulletin of the state
of my health. I go on much as I did at Stowey,
and my physicians have made no alterations in the
plan of treatment: I am not worse, and they tell me
I shall be better. Now for Mr. Baker&mdash;I am very
glad that he is occupied with those enquiries. I am
particularly anxious for information on the generation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
of eels; it is an unsolved problem since the
time of Aristotle. I am sure that all eels come
from the sea, where they are bred; but there may
be one or two species or varieties of them. What
Mr. Baker says about the difference between the
common eel and the conger is well worthy of attention;
but I have known changes more extraordinary
than the obliteration, or destruction, of a small
tubular member occasioned by difference of habits.</p>

<p>Were the salt-water eels and the fresh-water eels
which he examined of the same size? Many individuals
of various sizes should be examined to
establish the fact of their specific difference. This
would be the season for examining the genital
organs of eels, for they breed in winter; and were I
a little better, I should go to the sea for the purpose
of making enquiries on the subject.</p>

<p>Sir Everard Home is firmly convinced that the
animal is hermaphrodite and impregnates itself:
this, though possible, appears to me very strange
in so large an animal. If Mr. Baker will determine
this point, I can promise him an immortality
amongst our philosophical anglers and natural historians;
and if he will give us the history of water-flies,
imitated by fly-fishers, he will command our
immediate gratitude.</p>

<p>Pray communicate this letter to him with my
best wishes, and with my hopes that his talents,
which are very great, will be applied to enlighten us.</p>

<p>I can give you no news; the weather is dreadful,
and the blacks and yellows are descending in fog.
I long for the fresh air of your mountains.</p>

<p>God bless you, my dear Poole. Many&mdash;many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
happy new years to you. Pray remember me, with
the compliments of this day, to your excellent
neighbours at Stowey. Your affectionate friend,</p>

<p class="signature"><span class="smcap">H. Davy</span>.</p>

<p class="center">TO THE SAME.</p>

<p class="date">Park Street, March 26.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR POOLE,</p>

<p>Your letter has given me great pleasure; first,
because you, who are an enlightened judge in such
matters, approve of my humble contribution to
agriculture; and, secondly, because it makes me
acquainted with your kind feelings, health, and
Mr. Baker's interesting pursuits.</p>

<p>Mr. Baker appears to me to have distinctly established
the point that the eel and conger are of
different species; and from his zeal and activity,
I hope the curious problem of the generation of
these animals will be solved. I shall expect with
impatience the results of his enquiries.</p>

<p>Now for my health, my very dear friend. I wish
I could speak more favourably; I certainly do not
lose ground, but I am doubtful if I gain any; but
I do not despair.</p>

<p>I am going, by the advice of my physicians, to
try another Continental journey. If I get considerably
better, I shall winter in Italy, where, in this
case, I shall hope to see you, and where I shall have
an apartment ready for you in Rome.</p>

<p>I have not been idle since I left your comfortable
and hospitable house. I have finished my <em>Salmonia</em>,
and sent it to the press.&mdash;"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flumina amo sylvasque
inglorius.</i>"&mdash;I do not think you will be displeased
with this little <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu</i> of my sick hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
Mr. A&mdash;&mdash; was very amiable in calling on me.
There is nothing that annoys me so much in my
illness as my helplessness in not being able to indulge
in society.</p>

<p class="signature">Your grateful and affectionate friend,<br />
<span class="smcap j10">H. Davy</span>.</p>

</div>

<p>We will now, for a while, leave our philosopher
to pursue his journey to Italy, while we take a
review of his <span class="smcap">Salmonia</span>; the first edition of which
was published in the Spring of 1828. The second,
and much improved edition,<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> from which I shall
take my extracts, is dated from Laybach, Illyria,
September 28, 1828, but which did not appear
until 1829.</p>

<p>We are told in the preface, that these pages
formed the occupation of the author during some
months of severe and dangerous illness, when he
was wholly incapable of attending to more useful
studies, or of following more serious pursuits;&mdash;that
they constituted his amusement in many hours,
which otherwise would have been unoccupied and
tedious;&mdash;and that they are published in the hope
that they may possess an interest for those persons
who derive pleasure from the simplest and most
attainable kind of rural sports, and who practise the
art, or patronise the objects of contemplation, of the
philosophical angler.</p>

<p>He informs us that the conversational manner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
and discursive style were chosen as best suited to
the state of health of the author, who was incapable
of considerable efforts and long continued attention;
and he adds, that he could not but have in
mind a model, which has fully proved the utility
and popularity of this method of treating this subject&mdash;"The
Complete Angler," by Walton and
Cotton.</p>

<p>The characters chosen to support these conversations,
were <span class="smcap">Halieus</span>, who is supposed to be an
accomplished fly-fisher&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ornither</span>, who is to be
regarded as a gentleman generally fond of the
sports of the field, though not a finished master
of the art of angling&mdash;<span class="smcap">Poietes</span>, who is to be considered
as an enthusiastic lover of nature, and partially
acquainted with the mysteries of fly-fishing;
and <span class="smcap">Physicus</span>, who is described uninitiated as an
angler, but as a person fond of enquiries in natural
history and philosophy.</p>

<p>Such are the personages by whose aid the machinery
is to be worked; but he tells us that they
are of course imaginary, though the sentiments
attributed to them, the author may sometimes have
gained from recollections of real conversations with
friends, from whose society much of the happiness
of his early life had been derived; and he admits
that, in the portrait of the character of <span class="smcap">Halieus</span>,
given in the last dialogue, a likeness will not fail
to be recognised to that of the character of a most
estimable physician, ardently beloved by his friends,
and esteemed and venerated by the public.</p>

<p>The work is dedicated to Dr. Babington, "in remembrance
of some delightful days passed in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
society, and in gratitude for an uninterrupted friendship
of a quarter of a century."</p>

<p>I am informed by Lady Davy, that the engravings
of the fish, by which the work is illustrated,
are from drawings of his own execution; so
that he could not, like old Isaac Walton, "take the
liberty to commend the excellent pictures to him
that likes not the book, because they concern not
himself."</p>

<p>It has frequently happened that, while works of
deep importance have justly conferred celebrity
upon the author, his minor productions have been
entirely indebted to his name for their popularity,
and to his authority for their value. This, however,
cannot be said of Salmonia, for it possesses
the stamp of original genius, and bears internal
evidence of a talent flowing down from a very high
source of intelligence. In a scientific point of view,
it exhibits that penetrating observation by which a
gifted mind is enabled to extract out of the most
ordinary facts and every-day incidents, novel views
and hidden truths; while it shows that a humble
art (I beg pardon of the brothers of the Angle)
may, through the skill of the master, be made the
means of calling forth the affections of the heart,
and of reflecting all the colours of the fancy. By
regarding the work in relation to the history and
condition of its author, it certainly acquires much
additional interest. The familiar and inviting style
of the dialogue, whenever he discusses questions
of natural history, must convince us that he was as
well calculated to instruct in the Lyceum, as we
long since knew him to be to teach in the Academy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
Composed in the hour of sickness and prostration,
the work displays throughout its composition a tone
of dignified morality and an expansion of feeling,
which may be regarded as in unison with a mind
chastened but not subdued, and looking forward to
a better state of existence. "I envy," says he, "no
quality of the mind or intellect in others; be it
genius, power, wit, or fancy: but if I could choose
what would be most delightful, and I believe most
useful to me, I should prefer a firm religious belief
to every other blessing; for it makes life a discipline
of goodness; creates new hopes, when all earthly
hopes vanish; and throws over the decay, the destruction
of existence, the most gorgeous of all
lights; awakens life even in death, and from corruption
and decay calls up beauty and divinity;
makes an instrument of torture and of shame the
ladder of ascent to paradise; and, far above all combinations
of earthly hopes, calls up the most delightful
visions of palms and amaranths, the gardens of
the blest, the security of everlasting joys, where the
sensualist and the sceptic view only gloom, decay,
annihilation, and despair!"</p>

<p>While describing an animated scene of insect enjoyment,
he bursts into an apostrophe, highly characteristic
of that quick and happy talent for seizing
analogies, which so eminently distinguished all his
writings. I shall quote the passage.</p>

<p>"<em>Physicus.</em>&mdash;Since the sun has disappeared, the
cool of the evening has, I suppose, driven the little
winged plunderers to their homes; but see, there
are two or three humble bees which seem languid
with the cold, and yet they have their tongues still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
in the fountain of honey. I believe one of them is
actually dead, yet his mouth is still attached to the
flower. He has fallen asleep, and probably died
whilst making his last meal of ambrosia.</p>

<p>"<em>Ornither.</em>&mdash;What an enviable destiny, quitting
life in the moment of enjoyment, following an instinct,
the gratification of which has been always
pleasurable! so beneficent are the laws of Divine
Wisdom.</p>

<p>"<em>Physicus.</em>&mdash;Like Ornither, I consider the destiny
of this insect as desirable, and I cannot help
regarding the end of human life as most happy,
when terminated under the impulse of some strong
energetic feeling, similar in its nature to an instinct.
I should not wish to die like Attila, in a moment of
gross sensual enjoyment; but the death of Epaminondas
or Nelson, in the arms of victory, their whole
attention absorbed in the love of glory, and of their
country, I think really enviable.</p>

<p>"<em>Poietes.</em>&mdash;I consider the death of the martyr or
the saint as far more enviable; for, in this case,
what may be considered as a Divine instinct of our
nature is called into exertion, and pain is subdued,
or destroyed, by a secure faith in the power and
mercy of the Divinity. In such cases, man rises
above mortality, and shows his true intellectual superiority.
By intellectual superiority, I mean that
of his spiritual nature, for I do not consider the results
of reason as capable of being compared with
those of faith. Reason is often a dead weight in life,
destroying feeling, and substituting, for principle,
calculation and caution; and, in the hour of death, it
often produces fear or despondency, and is rather a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
bitter draught than nectar or ambrosia in the last
meal of life.</p>

<p>"<em>Halieus.</em>&mdash;I agree with Poietes. The higher and
more intense the feeling under which death takes
place, the happier it may be esteemed; and I think
even Physicus will be of our opinion, when I recollect
the conclusion of a conversation in Scotland.
The immortal being never can quit life with so
much pleasure as with the feeling of immortality
secure, and the vision of celestial glory filling the
mind, affected by no other passion than the pure
and intense love of God."</p>

<p>We are not to suppose that, however soothing
and consolatory such feelings and hopes may have
been, they weaned him from the world, or diminished
his natural love of life; on the contrary, no one
would have more gratefully received the services of
a Medea, as the following passage will sufficiently
testify. "Ah! could I recover any thing like that
freshness of mind which I possessed at twenty-five,
and which, like the dew of the dawning morning,
covered all objects and nourished all things that
grew, and in which they were more beautiful even
than in midday sunshine,&mdash;what would I not give!
All that I have gained in an active and not unprofitable
life. How well I remember that delightful
season, when, full of power, I sought for power in
others; and power was sympathy, and sympathy
power;&mdash;when the dead and the unknown, the
great of other ages and of distant places were made,
by the force of the imagination, my companions and
friends;&mdash;when every voice seemed one of praise
and love;&mdash;when every flower had the bloom and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
odour of the rose; and every spray or plant seemed
either the poet's laurel, or the civic oak&mdash;which appeared
to offer themselves as wreaths to adorn my
throbbing brow. But, alas! this cannot be.&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>After the example of the great Patriarch of Anglers,
the author of Salmonia commences, through
the assistance of the principal interlocutor of the
dialogue, <span class="smcap">Halieus</span>, to enumerate the delights of
his art, and to vindicate it from the charge of
cruelty.</p>

<p>"<em>Halieus.</em>&mdash;The search after food is an instinct
belonging to our nature; and from the savage in
his rudest and most primitive state, who destroys a
piece of game, or a fish, with a club or spear, to
man in the most cultivated state of society, who
employs artifice, machinery, and the resources of
various other animals, to secure his object, the
origin of the pleasure is similar, and its object the
same: but that kind of it requiring most art may
be said to characterize man in his highest or intellectual
state; and the fisher for salmon and trout
with the fly employs not only machinery to assist
his physical powers, but applies sagacity to conquer
difficulties; and the pleasure derived from ingenious
resources and devices, as well as from active
pursuit, belongs to this amusement. Then, as to
its philosophical tendency, it is a pursuit of moral
discipline, requiring patience, forbearance, and command
of temper. As connected with natural science,
it may be vaunted as demanding a knowledge of the
habits of a considerable tribe of created beings,&mdash;fishes,
and the animals that they prey upon, and
an acquaintance with the signs and tokens of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
weather, and its changes, the nature of waters, and
of the atmosphere. As to its poetical relations, it
carries us into the most wild and beautiful scenery
of nature; amongst the mountain lakes, and the
clear and lovely streams that gush from the higher
ranges of elevated hills, or that make their way
through the cavities of calcareous strata. How delightful
in the early spring, after the dull and tedious
time of winter, when the frosts disappear and
the sunshine warms the earth and waters, to wander
forth by some clear stream, to see the leaf bursting
from the purple bud, to scent the odours of the
bank perfumed by the violet, and enamelled, as it
were, with the primrose and the daisy; to wander
upon the fresh turf below the shade of trees, whose
bright blossoms are filled with the music of the bee;
and on the surface of the waters to view the gaudy
flies sparkling like animated gems in the sunbeams,
whilst the bright and beautiful trout is watching
them from below; to hear the twittering of the
water birds, who, alarmed at your approach, rapidly
hide themselves beneath the flowers and leaves of
the water-lily; and, as the season advances, to find
all these objects changed for others of the same
kind, but better and brighter, till the swallow and
the trout contend, as it were, for the gaudy Mayfly,
and till, in pursuing your amusement in the
calm and balmy evening, you are serenaded by the
songs of the cheerful thrush and melodious nightingale,
performing the offices of paternal love, in
thickets ornamented with the rose and woodbine."</p>

<p>On vindicating the pursuit from the charge of
cruelty, he has advanced an argument that has not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
been commonly adduced upon this occasion. We
have indeed all heard, that the operation of skinning
is a matter of indifference to eels when they are
used to it; but we are now told fish are so little
annoyed by the hook, that though a trout has
been hooked and played with for some minutes, he
will often, after his escape with the artificial fly in
his mouth, take the natural fly, and feed as if nothing
had happened; having apparently learnt only
from the experiment, that the artificial fly is not
proper food. "I have caught pikes with four or
five hooks in their mouths, and tackle which they
had broken only a few minutes before; and the
hooks seemed to have had no other effect than that
of serving as a sort of <i>sauce piquante</i>, urging them
to seize another morsel of the same kind."</p>

<p>Our author, however, takes a more special defence,
by observing that, unlike old Isaac, he employs an
artificial fly, instead of a living bait. Our notions
about the cruelty of field sports is extremely capricious.
Until the time of the Reformation, the canon
law prohibited the use of the sanguinary recreations
of hunting, hawking, and fowling, while the clergy,
on account of their leisure, were allowed to exercise
the harmless and humane art of angling. In later
days, the indignation against this art has been excited
by the supposed sufferings of the worm or bait,
rather than by those of the fish; and thus far the
author of Salmonia assumed a strong posture of
defence; but he did not avail himself of all the advantages
it commanded. He might have pleaded,
that every fish he caught by his artificial fly was destined
to prey upon an insect, and that by substituting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
a piece of silk for the latter, he would for every
fish he might destroy, save from destruction many of
those fairy beings that animate the air and sparkle in
the sunbeam;&mdash;but it is, after all, folly to argue
upon the subject of cruelty in our field sports.
That animals should live by preying upon each other
is the very basis of the scheme of creation; and in
these days it is not necessary to expose the absurdities
of the system of Samos and Indostan. Dr.
Franklin, at one period of his life, entertained a sentimental
abhorrence at eating any thing that had
possessed life; and the reader may, perhaps, not
object to be reminded of the manner in which he
was cured of his prejudice. "I considered," says he,
"the capture of every fish as a sort of murder, committed
without provocation, since these animals had
neither done, nor were capable of doing, the smallest
injury to any one that should justify the measure.
This mode of reasoning I conceived to be unanswerable.
Meanwhile, I had formerly been extremely
fond of fish; and when one of the cod was taken out
of the frying-pan, I thought its flavour delicious. I
hesitated some time between principle and inclination,
till at last recollecting that, when the cod had
been opened, some small fish were found in its belly,
I said to myself, 'If you eat each other, I see no
reason why we may not eat you,'&mdash;(His "wish was
father to that thought")&mdash;I accordingly dined on the
cod with no small degree of pleasure, and have since
continued to eat like the rest of mankind."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halieus</span> is made to admit the danger of analysing
too closely the moral character of any of our field
sports; and yet, in the concluding chapter, he very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
unfairly and inconsistently attempts to ridicule the
pursuit of a fox-hunter, "risking his neck to see the
hounds destroy an animal which he preserves to be
destroyed, and which is good for nothing." He
who pursues a pleasure because it is rational, reasons
because he cannot feel. "When the heart," says
Sterne, "flies out before the understanding, it saves
the judgment a world of pains."</p>

<p>Having, as the author thinks satisfactorily, settled
the preliminary questions, <span class="smcap">Halieus</span>, succeeds in
persuading <span class="smcap">Physicus</span> to join him in fishing excursions;
just as <em>Piscator</em> is represented by old Isaac,
as having enlisted <em>Venator</em> into the brotherhood of
the angle.</p>

<p>The dialogue now proceeds with great animation,
during which the art and mystery of Piscatory
tactics are unfolded with great skill; for the details
of which the reader must be referred to the work
itself. If, however, he be not already an angler, it
may save him a world of pains to be informed, that
to learn to fish by the book is little less absurd than
"to make hay by the fair days in the almanack."</p>

<p>The manner in which he treats the various subjects
of natural history necessarily connected with the
pursuit is both amusing and instructive; and the
whole work is studded and gemmed, as it were, with
the most poetical descriptions.</p>

<p>In speaking of the swallow, <em>Poietes</em> exclaims&mdash;"I
delight in this living landscape! The swallow is
one of my favourite birds, and a rival of the nightingale;
for he cheers my sense of seeing as much as
the other does my sense of hearing. He is the glad
prophet of the year, the harbinger of the best season:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
he lives a life of enjoyment amongst the loveliest
forms of nature: winter is unknown to him; and he
leaves the green meadows of England in autumn,
for the myrtle and orange groves of Italy, and for
the palms of Africa: he has always objects of pursuit,
and his success is secure. Even the beings
selected for his prey are poetical, beautiful, and transient.
The ephemeræ are saved by his means from
a slow and lingering death in the evening, and
killed in a moment, when they have known nothing
of life but pleasure. He is the constant destroyer
of insects&mdash;the friend of man; and, with the stork
and the ibis, may be regarded as a sacred bird. His
instinct, which gives him his appointed seasons, and
teaches him always when and where to move, may
be regarded as flowing from a divine source; and he
belongs to the oracles of Nature, which speak the
awful and intelligible language of a present Deity."</p>

<p><em>Poietes</em> considers a full and clear river as the
most poetical object in Nature.&mdash;"I will not fail
to obey your summons. Pliny has, as well as I
recollect, compared a river to human life. I have
never read the passage in his works; but I have
been a hundred times struck with the analogy,
particularly amidst mountain scenery. The river,
small and clear in its origin, gushes forth from
rocks, falls into deep glens, and wantons and meanders
through a wild and picturesque country, nourishing
only the uncultivated tree or flower by its
dew or spray. In this, its state of infancy and
youth, it may be compared to the human mind,
in which fancy and strength of imagination are
predominant&mdash;it is more beautiful than useful.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
When the different rills or torrents join, and descend
into the plain, it becomes slow and stately
in its motions; it is applied to move machinery, to
irrigate meadows, and to bear upon its bosom the
stately barge;&mdash;in this mature state it is deep,
strong, and useful. As it flows on towards the sea,
it loses its force and its motion, and at last, as it
were, becomes lost, and mingled with the mighty
abyss of waters."</p>

<p><em>Halieus</em> adds&mdash;"One might pursue the metaphor
still farther, and say, that in its origin&mdash;its thundering
and foam, when it carries down clay from
the bank, and becomes impure, it resembles the
youthful mind, affected by dangerous passions.
And the influence of a lake, in calming and clearing
the turbid water, may be compared to the effect of
reason in more mature life, when the tranquil, deep,
cool, and unimpassioned mind is freed from its
fever, its troubles, bubbles, noise, and foam. And,
above all, the sources of a river&mdash;which may be
considered as belonging to the atmosphere&mdash;and
its termination in the ocean, may be regarded as
imaging the divine origin of the human mind, and
its being ultimately returned to, and lost in, the infinite
and eternal Intelligence from which it originally
sprang."</p>

<p><em>Halieus</em> offers some curious observations with
respect to the recollection of fish being associated
with surrounding objects.</p>

<p>"I have known a fish that I have pricked retain
his station in the river, and refuse the artificial fly,
day after day, for weeks together; but his memory
may have been kept awake by this practice, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
recollection seems local, and associated with surrounding
objects; and if a pricked trout is chased
into another pool, he will, I believe, soon again
take the artificial fly. Or, if the objects around
him are changed, as in autumn, by the decay of
weeds, or by their being cut, the same thing happens;
and a flood or a rough wind, I believe, assists
the fly-fisher, not merely by obscuring the vision
of the fish, but, in a river much fished, by changing
the appearance of their haunts: large trouts
almost always occupy particular stations, under, or
close to, a large stone or tree; and probably, most
of their recollected sensations are connected with
this dwelling.</p>

<p>"<em>Physicus.</em>&mdash;I think I understand you, that the
memory of the danger and pain does not last long,
unless there is a permanent sensation with which
it can remain associated,&mdash;such as the station of the
trout; and that the recollection of the mere form
of the artificial fly, without this association, is
evanescent.</p>

<p>"<em>Ornither.</em>&mdash;You are diving into metaphysics;
yet, I think, in fowling, I have observed that the
memory of birds is local. A woodcock that has
been much shot at and scared in a particular wood,
runs to the side where he has usually escaped, the
moment he hears the dogs; but if driven into a
new wood, he seems to lose his acquired habits of
caution, and becomes stupid."</p>

<p>In alluding to the migrations of fishes, <em>Physicus</em>
observes, "That he has always considered that the
two great sources of change of place of animals,
was the providing of food for themselves, and resting-places
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
and food for their young. The great
supposed migrations of herrings from the poles to
the temperate zone appear to be only the approach
of successive shoals from deep to shallow water, for
the purpose of spawning. The migrations of salmon
and trout are evidently for the purpose of depositing
their ova, or of finding food after they have
spawned."</p>

<p>In explaining the circumstances which render a
migration into shallow water necessary for the developement
of the ova, Davy evidently bears in
mind the result of his very first experiment.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>"Carp, perch, and pike, deposit their ova in still
water, in spring and summer, <em>when it is supplied with
air by the growth of vegetables; and it is to the leaves
of plants, which afford a continual supply of oxygen
to the water, that the impregnated eggs usually
adhere</em>." Again: "Fish in spawning-time always
approach great shallows, or shores covered with
weeds, <em>which, in the process of their growth, under
the influence of the sunshine, constantly supply pure
air to the water in contact with them</em>."</p>

<p>The following passage will afford a good specimen
of the familiar dialogue, while it will convey
to the reader some curious facts connected with the
influence of sunshine.</p>

<p>"<em>Halieus.</em>&mdash;Well, gentlemen, what sport?</p>

<p>"<em>Poietes.</em>&mdash;The fish are rising every where; but
though we have been throwing over them with all
our skill for a quarter of an hour, yet not a single
one will take; and I am afraid we shall return to
breakfast without our prey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
"<em>Halieus.</em>&mdash;I will try; but I shall go to the other
side, where I see a very large fish rising&mdash;There!&mdash;I
have him at the very first throw&mdash;Land this fish,
and put him into the well. Now, I have another;
and I have no doubt I could take half-a-dozen in
this very place, where you have been so long in
fishing without success.</p>

<p>"<em>Physicus.</em>&mdash;You must have a different fly; or,
have you some unguent or charm to tempt the fish?</p>

<p>"<em>Halieus.</em>&mdash;No such thing. If any of you will
give me your rod and fly, I will answer for it. I
shall have the same success. I take your rod, Physicus&mdash;and
lo! I have a fish!</p>

<p>"<em>Physicus.</em>&mdash;What can be the reason of this? It
is perfectly inexplicable to me. Yet Poietes seems
to throw as light as you do, and as well as he did
yesterday.</p>

<p>"<em>Halieus.</em>&mdash;I am surprised that you, who are a
philosopher, cannot discover the reason of this&mdash;Think
a little.</p>

<p>"<em>All.</em>&mdash;We cannot.</p>

<p>"<em>Halieus.</em>&mdash;As you are my scholars, I believe
I must teach you. The sun is bright, and you
have been, naturally enough, fishing with your
backs to the sun, which, not being very high, has
thrown the shadows of your rods and yourselves
upon the water, and you have alarmed the fish,
wherever you have thrown a fly. You see, I have
fished with my face towards the sun, and though
inconvenienced by the light, have given no alarm.
Follow my example, and you will soon have sport,
as there is a breeze playing on the water.</p>

<p>"<em>Physicus.</em>&mdash;Your sagacity puts me in mind of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
an anecdote which I remember to have heard respecting
the late eloquent statesman, Charles James
Fox; who, walking up Bond Street from one of
the club-houses with an illustrious personage, laid
him a wager, that he would see more cats than the
Prince in his walk, and that he might take which
side of the way he liked. When they got to the
top, it was found, that Mr. Fox had seen thirteen
cats, and the Prince not one. The Royal personage
asked for an explanation of this apparent miracle,
and Mr. Fox said, 'Your Royal Highness took, of
course, the shady side of the way, as most agreeable;
I knew that the sunny side would be left to
me,&mdash;and cats always prefer the sunshine.'</p>

<p>"<em>Halieus.</em>&mdash;There! Poietes, by following my
advice, you have immediately hooked a fish; and
while you are catching a brace, I will tell you an
anecdote, which as much relates to fly-fishing as
that of Physicus, and affords an elucidation of a
particular effect of light.</p>

<p>"A manufacturer of carmine, who was aware of
the superiority of the French colour, went to Lyons
for the purpose of improving his process, and bargained
with the most celebrated manufacturer in
that capital for the acquisition of his secret, for
which he was to pay a thousand pounds. He was
shown all the processes, and saw a beautiful colour
produced, yet he found not the least difference in
the French mode of fabrication and that which he
had constantly adopted. He appealed to the manufacturer,
and insisted that he must have concealed
something. The manufacturer assured him that he
had not, and invited him to see the process a second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
time. He minutely examined the water and the
materials, which were the same as his own, and, very
much surprised, said, 'I have lost my labour and
my money, for the air of England does not permit
us to make good carmine.'&mdash;'Stay,' says the Frenchman,
'do not deceive yourself; what kind of weather
is it now?'&mdash;'A bright, sunny day,' said the
Englishman.&mdash;'And such are the days,' said the
Frenchman, 'on which I make my colour. Were
I to attempt to manufacture it on a dark or cloudy
day, my result would be the same as yours. Let
me advise you, my friend, always to make carmine
on bright and sunny days.'&mdash;'I will,' says the Englishman,
'but I fear I shall make very little in
London.'</p>

<p>"<em>Poietes.</em>&mdash;Your anecdote is as much to the purpose
as Physicus's; yet I am much obliged to you
for the hint respecting the effect of shadow, for I
have several times, in May and June, had to complain
of too clear a sky, and wished, with Cotton, for</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">'A day with not too bright a beam;</div>
<div class="line i0f">A warm, but not a scorching sun.'"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A very amusing and philosophical conversation
on those natural phenomena, which have been vulgarly
viewed as prophetic of dry or wet weather,
may be well adduced as illustrative of that genius
which, by the aid of a light of its own, imparts to
the most trite objects all the charms of novelty.</p>

<p>"<em>Poietes.</em>&mdash;I hope we shall have another good
day to-morrow, for the clouds are red in the west.</p>

<p>"<em>Physicus.</em>&mdash;I have no doubt of it, for the red
has a tint of purple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
"<em>Halieus.</em>&mdash;Do you know why this tint portends
fine weather?</p>

<p>"<em>Physicus.</em>&mdash;The air when dry, I believe, refracts
more red, or heat-making rays; and as dry air is not
perfectly transparent, they are again reflected in the
horizon. I have generally observed a coppery or
yellow sunset to foretell rain; but, as an indication
of wet weather approaching, nothing is more certain
than a halo round the moon, which is produced by
the precipitated water; and the larger the circle, the
nearer the clouds, and consequently the more ready
to fall.</p>

<p>"<em>Halieus.</em>&mdash;I have often observed, that the old
proverb is correct&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">'A rainbow in the morning is the shepherd's warning;</div>
<div class="line i0f">A rainbow at night is the shepherd's delight.'</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>&mdash;Can you explain this omen?</p>

<p>"<em>Physicus.</em>&mdash;A rainbow can only occur when the
clouds containing or depositing the rain are opposite
to the sun; and in the evening the rainbow is in the
east, and in the morning in the west; and as our
heavy rains in this climate are usually brought by
the westerly wind, a rainbow in the west indicates
that the bad weather is on the road, by the wind, to
us; whereas the rainbow in the east proves, that the
rain in these clouds is passing from us.</p>

<p>"<em>Poietes.</em>&mdash;I have often observed, that when the
swallows fly high, fine weather is to be expected or
continued; but when they fly low and close to the
ground, rain is almost surely approaching. Can you
account for this?</p>

<p>"<em>Halieus.</em>&mdash;Swallows follow the flies and gnats,
and flies and gnats usually delight in warm strata of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
air; and as warm air is lighter, and usually moister
than cold air, when the warm strata of air are high,
there is less chance of moisture being thrown down
from them by the mixture with cold air; but when
the warm and moist air is close to the surface, it is
almost certain, that as the cold air flows down into
it, a deposition of water will take place.</p>

<p>"<em>Poietes.</em>&mdash;I have often seen sea-gulls assemble on
the land, and have almost always observed, that very
stormy and rainy weather was approaching. I conclude
that these animals, sensible of a current of air
approaching from the ocean, retire to the land to
shelter themselves from the storm.</p>

<p>"<em>Ornither.</em>&mdash;No such thing. The storm is their
element; and the little petrel enjoys the heaviest
gale; because, living on the smaller sea insects, he is
sure to find his food in the spray of a heavy wave.
And you may see him flitting above the edge of the
highest surge. I believe that the reason of the migration
of sea-gulls and other sea birds to the land,
is their security of finding food. They may be observed,
at this time, feeding greedily on the earth
worms and larvæ driven out of the ground by
severe floods; and the fish on which they prey in
fine weather in the sea, leave the surface when storms
prevail, and go deeper. The search after food, as
we agreed on a former occasion, is the principal
cause why animals change their places. The different
tribes of the wading birds always migrate
when rain is about to take place; and I remember
once in Italy having been long waiting, in the end
of March, for the arrival of the double snipe in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
Campagna of Rome: a great flight appeared on the
3rd of April, and the day after heavy rain set in,
which greatly interfered with my sport. The vulture,
upon the same principle, follows armies; and I
have no doubt, that the augury of the ancients was
a good deal founded upon the observation of the
instincts of birds. There are many superstitions of
the vulgar owing to the same source. For anglers,
in spring, it is always unlucky to see <em>single</em> magpies;
but <em>two</em> may be always regarded as a favourable
omen; and the reason is, that in cold and stormy
weather, one magpie alone leaves the nest in search
of food, the other remaining sitting upon the eggs or
the young ones; but when two go out together, the
weather is warm and mild, and thus favourable for
fishing.</p>

<p>"<em>Poietes.</em>&mdash;The singular connexions of cause and
effect, to which you have just referred, make superstition
less to be wondered at, particularly amongst
the vulgar; and when two facts, naturally unconnected,
have been accidentally coincident, it is not
singular that this coincidence should have been observed
and registered, and that omens of the most
absurd kind should be trusted in. In the West of
England, half a century ago, a particular hollow
noise on the sea-coast was referred to a spirit or
goblin, called Bucca, and was supposed to foretell a
shipwreck; the philosopher knows, that sound travels
much faster than currents in the air&mdash;and the
sound always foretold the approach of a very heavy
storm, which seldom takes place on that wild and
rocky coast, surrounded as it is by the Atlantic,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
without a shipwreck on some part of its extensive
shores.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>"<em>Physicus.</em>&mdash;All the instances of omens you have
mentioned are founded on reason; but how can you
explain such absurdities as Friday being an unlucky
day, the terror of spilling salt, or meeting an old
woman? I knew a man of very high dignity, who
was exceedingly moved by these omens, and who
never went out shooting without a bittern's claw
fastened to his button-hole by a riband&mdash;which he
thought ensured him good luck.</p>

<p>"<em>Poietes.</em>&mdash;These, as well as the omens of deathwatches,
dreams, &amp;c. are for the most part founded
upon some accidental coincidences; but spilling of
salt, on an uncommon occasion, may, as I have
known it, arise from a disposition to apoplexy,
shown by an incipient numbness in the hand, and
may be a fatal symptom; and persons dispirited
by bad omens sometimes prepare the way for evil
fortune; for confidence in success is a great means
of insuring it. The dream of Brutus, before the
field of Philippi, probably produced a species of
irresolution and despondency, which was the principal
cause of his losing the battle; and I have
heard, that the illustrious sportsman, to whom you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
referred just now, was always observed to shoot ill,
because he shot carelessly, after one of his dispiriting
omens.</p>

<p>"<em>Halieus.</em>&mdash;I have in life met with a few things
which I found it impossible to explain, either by
chance, coincidences, or by natural connexions; and
I have known minds of a very superior class affected
by them,&mdash;persons in the habit of reasoning deeply
and profoundly.</p>

<p>"<em>Physicus.</em>&mdash;In my opinion, profound minds are
the most likely to think lightly of the resources of
human reason; it is the pert, superficial thinker
who is generally strongest in every kind of unbelief.
The deep philosopher sees chains of causes and
effects so wonderfully and strangely linked together,
that he is usually the last person to decide upon
the impossibility of any two series of events being
independent of each other; and in science, so many
natural miracles, as it were, have been brought to
light,&mdash;such as the fall of stones from meteors in the
atmosphere, the disarming a thunder-cloud by a
metallic point, the production of fire from ice by a
metal white as silver, and referring certain laws of
motion of the sea to the moon,&mdash;that the physical
enquirer is seldom disposed to assert, confidently,
on any abstruse subjects belonging to the order of
natural things, and still less so on those relating to
the more mysterious relations of moral events and
intellectual natures."</p>

<p>Old Isaac Walton has amused us with a variety
of absurd fables and superstitions: the author of
Salmonia, on the other hand, touches, as with the
spear of Ithuriel, the monsters and prodigies of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
older writers, and they at once assume the forms of
well-ascertained animals, or vegetables. The <em>sea
snake</em> seen by American and Norwegian captains,
appears as a company of porpoises, which in their
gambols, by rising and sinking in lines, would give
somewhat the appearance of the coils of a snake.
The <em>Kraken</em>, or island fish, is reduced into an assemblage
of <em>urticæ marinæ</em>, or sea blubbers. The
<em>Mermaid</em>, into the long-haired seal;<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> and lastly,
the celebrated Caithness Mermaid assumes the unpoetical
form of a stout young traveller;&mdash;but this
story is far too amusing to be dismissed with a passing
notice.</p>

<p>"A worthy Baronet, remarkable for his benevolent
views and active spirit, has propagated a story
of this kind, and he seems to claim for his native
country the honour of possessing this extraordinary
animal; but the mermaid of Caithness was certainly
a <em>gentleman</em>, who happened to be travelling
on that wild shore, and who was seen bathing by
some young ladies at so great a distance, that not
only <em>genus</em> but gender was mistaken. I am acquainted
with him, and have had the story from his
own mouth. He is a young man, fond of geological
pursuits, and one day in the middle of August,
having fatigued and heated himself by climbing a
rock to examine a particular appearance of granite,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
he gave his clothes to his Highland guide, who was
taking care of his pony, and descended to the sea.
The sun was just setting, and he amused himself
for some time by swimming from rock to rock, and
having unclipped hair and no cap, he sometimes
threw aside his locks, and wrung the water from
them on the rocks. He happened the year after to
be at Harrowgate, and was sitting at table with two
young ladies from Caithness, who were relating to
a wondering audience the story of the mermaid
they had seen, which had already been published in
the newspapers: they described her, as she usually
is described by poets, as a beautiful animal with
remarkably fair skin and long green hair. The
young gentleman took the liberty, as most of the
rest of the company did, to put a few questions to
the elder of the two ladies,&mdash;such as, on what day
and precisely where this singular phenomenon had
appeared. She had noted down not merely the day,
but the hour and minute, and produced a map of
the place. Our bather referred to his journal, and
showed that a human animal was swimming in the
very spot at that very time, who had some of the
characters ascribed to the mermaid, but who laid no
claim to others, particularly the green hair and fish's
tail, but, being rather sallow in the face, was glad
to have such testimony to the colour of his body
beneath his garments."</p>

<p>With this story, I must conclude my review of
"Salmonia,"&mdash;a work of considerable scientific and
popular interest, and which cannot fail to become
the favourite companion of the philosophical angler.
The only production with which it can be at all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
compared is that of the "Complete Angler, by
Izaac Walton." I agree with the critic who regards
the two authors as pilgrims bound for the
same shrine, resembling each other in their general
habit&mdash;the scalloped hat, the dalmatique, and the
knobbed and spiked staff&mdash;which equalize all who
assume the character; yet, though alike in purpose,
dress, and demeanour, the observant eye can doubtless
discern an essential difference betwixt those
devotees. The burgess does not make his approach
to the shrine with the stately pace of a knight or
a noble; the simple and uninformed rustic has not
the contemplative step of the philosopher, or the
quick glance of the poet. The palm of originality
and of exquisite simplicity, which cannot perhaps
be imitated with entire success, must remain with
the common father of anglers&mdash;the patriarch Izaac;
but it would be absurd to compare his work with the
one written by the most distinguished philosopher
of the nineteenth century, whose genius, like a sunbeam,
illumined every recess which it penetrated,
imparting to scarcely visible objects, definite forms
and various colours.</p>

<p>If the advanced age of Walton was pleaded by
himself as a sufficient reason for procuring "<em>a writ
of ease</em>," the friends of Davy may surely claim at
the hands of the critic an indulgent reception for
a congenial work written in the hour of bodily lassitude
and sickness. This benevolent feeling, however,
did not penetrate every heart. A passage,
which I shall presently quote, appears to have given
great offence to the President of the Mechanics'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
Institute, and to have been considered by him as
the indication of a covert hostility to the spread of
knowledge. The earth had scarcely closed upon the
remains of the philosopher, when, in his anniversary
speech,<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> the Autocrat of all the Mechanics,
availing himself of this pretext, assailed his character
with the charge of "conceit, pride, and arrogance."</p>

<p>The following is the passage in Salmonia, which
provoked this angry and unjust philippic.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to say, I think the system carried
too far in England. God forbid, that any useful
light should be extinguished! let the persons who
wish for education receive it; but it appears to me
that, in the great cities in England, it is, as it were,
forced upon the population; and that sciences,
which the lower classes can only very superficially
acquire, are presented to them; in consequence of
which they often become idle and conceited, and
above their usual laborious occupations. The unripe
fruit of the tree of knowledge is, I believe,
always bitter or sour; and scepticism and discontentment&mdash;sicknesses
of the mind&mdash;are often the
result of devouring it."</p>

<p>Methinks I hear the reader exclaim&mdash;"How
little could Davy imagine that his prophetic words
would have been so soon fulfilled!"&mdash;But I would
seriously recommend to the President of the Mechanics'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
Institute, an anecdote which, if properly
applied, cannot fail to be instructive.&mdash;When
Diogenes, trampling with his dirty feet on the embroidered
couch of Plato, cried out&mdash;"<em>Thus do I
trample on the pride of Plato!</em>" the philosopher
shook his head, and replied&mdash;"<em>Truly, but with more
pride thou dost it, good Diogenes.</em>"</p>

<p>A short time before Sir Humphry Davy quitted
England, to which he was destined never to return,
he communicated to the Royal Society a paper "On
the Phenomena of Volcanoes;" which was read on
the 20th of March 1828, and published in the Transactions
of that year.</p>

<p>The object of this memoir was to collect and record
the various observations and experiments which
he had made on Vesuvius, during his several visits to
that volcano. The appearances which it presented
in 1814 and 1815 have been already noticed; it was
in December 1819, and during the two succeeding
months, that the mountain offered a favourable opportunity
for making those experiments which form
the principal subject of the present communication.</p>

<p>It was a point of great importance to determine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
whether any combustion was going on at the moment
the lava issued from the mountain; for this
fact being once discovered, and the nature of the
combustible matter ascertained, we should gain an
immense step towards a just theory of the sources of
volcanic action. For this purpose, he carefully examined
both the lava and the elastic fluids with
which it was accompanied. He was unable, however,
to detect any thing like deflagration with nitre,
which must have taken place had the smallest quantity
of carbonaceous matter been present; nor could
he, by exposing the ignited mass to portions of atmospheric
air, discover that any appreciable quantity
of oxygen had been absorbed. On immersing
fused lava in water, no decomposition of that fluid
followed, so that there could not have existed any
quantity of the metallic bases of the alkalies or
earths. Common salt, chloride of iron, the sulphates
and muriates of potash, and soda, generally constituted
the mass of solid products; while steam, muriatic
acid fumes, and occasionally sulphurous acid
vapours, formed the principal elastic matters disengaged.</p>

<p>He informs us it was on the 26th of January
1820, that he had the honour to accompany his
Royal Highness the Prince of Denmark in an excursion
to the mountain, on which occasion his
friend, Cavalier Monticelli, was also present. At
this time, the lava was seen nearly white hot through
a chasm near the place where it flowed from the
mountain; and yet, although he threw nitre upon it
in large quantities through this chasm, there was no
more increase of ignition than when the experiment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
was made on lava exposed to the free air. He observed
that the appearance of the sublimations was
very different from that which they had presented
on former occasions; those near the aperture were
coloured green and blue by salt of copper; but there
was, as usual, a great quantity of muriate of iron.
On the 5th, the sublimate of the lava was pure
chloride of sodium; in the sublimate of January 6th,
there were both sulphate of soda and indications of
sulphate of potash; but in those which he collected
during this last visit, the sulphate of soda was in
much larger quantities, and there was much more of
a salt of potash.</p>

<p>For nearly three months the craters, of which
there were two, were in activity. The larger one
threw up showers of ignited ashes and stones to a
height apparently of from two hundred to two hundred
and fifty feet; and from the smaller crater
steam arose with great violence. Whenever the
crater could be approached, it was found incrusted
with saline matter: and the walk to the edge of the
small crater, on the 6th of January, was through a
mass of loose saline matter, principally common salt
coloured by muriate of iron, in which the foot sunk
to some depth. It was easy, even at a great distance,
to distinguish between the steam disengaged
by one of the craters, and the earthy matter thrown
up by the other. The steam appeared white in the
day, and formed perfectly white clouds, which reflected
the morning and evening light of the purest
tints of red and orange. The earthy matter always
appeared as a black smoke, forming dark clouds, and
in the night it was highly luminous at the moment
of the explosion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
He concludes this paper on Volcanoes with some
observations on the theory of their phenomena. "It
appears," says he, "almost demonstrable, that none
of the chemical causes anciently assigned for volcanic
fires can be true. Amongst these, the combustion
of mineral coal is one of the most current;
but it seems wholly inadequate to account for the
phenomena. However large the stratum of pit-coal,
its combustion under the surface could never produce
violent and excessive heat; for the production
of carbonic acid gas, when there was no free circulation
of air, must tend constantly to impede the process:
and it is scarcely possible that carbonaceous
matter, if such a cause existed, should not be found
in the lava, and be disengaged with the saline or
aqueous products from the bocca or craters. There
are many instances in England of strata of mineral
coal which have been long burning; but the results
have been merely baked clay and schists, and it has
produced no result similar to lava.</p>

<p>"If the idea of Lemery were correct, that the action
of sulphur on iron may be a cause of volcanic
fires, sulphate of iron ought to be the great product
of the volcano; which is known not to be the case;
and the heat produced by the action of sulphur on
the common metals is quite inadequate to account
for the appearances. When it is considered that
volcanic fires occur and intermit with all the phenomena
that indicate intense chemical action, it seems
not unreasonable to refer them to chemical causes.
But for phenomena upon such a scale, an immense
mass of matter must be in activity, and the products
of the volcano ought to give an idea of the nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
of the substances primarily active. Now, what are
these products? Mixtures of the earths in an oxidated
and fused state, and intensely ignited; water
and saline substances, such as might be furnished
by the sea and air, altered in such a manner as
might be expected from the formation of fixed oxidated
matter. But it may be said, if the oxidation
of the metals of the earths be the causes of the phenomena,
some of these substances ought occasionally
to be found in the lava, or the combustion ought to
be increased at the moment the materials passed
into the atmosphere. But the reply to this objection
is, that it is evident that the changes which
occasion volcanic fires take place in immense subterranean
cavities; and that the access of air to the
acting substances occurs long before they reach the
exterior surface.</p>

<p>"There is no question but that the ground under
the solfaterra is hollow; and there is scarcely any
reason to doubt of a subterraneous communication
between this crater and that of Vesuvius: whenever
Vesuvius is in an active state, the solfaterra is comparatively
tranquil. I examined the bocca of the
solfaterra on the 21st of February 1820, two days
before the activity of Vesuvius was at its height:
the columns of steam which usually arise in large
quantities when Vesuvius is tranquil, were now
scarcely visible, and a piece of paper thrown into
the aperture did not rise again; so that there was
every reason to suppose the existence of a descending
current of air. The subterraneous thunder
heard at such great distances under Vesuvius is
almost a demonstration of the existence of great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
cavities below filled with aëriform matter: and the
same excavations which, in the active state of the
volcano, throw out, during so great a length of time,
immense volumes of steam, must, there is every
reason to believe, in its quiet state, become filled
with atmospheric air.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>"To what extent subterraneous cavities may
exist, even in common rocks, is shown in the limestone
caverns of Carniola, some of which contain
many hundred thousand cubical feet of air; and in
proportion as the depth of an excavation is greater,
so is the air more fit for combustion.</p>

<p>"The same circumstances which would give
alloys of the metals of the earths the power of producing
volcanic phenomena, namely, their extreme
facility of oxidation, must likewise prevent them
from ever being found in a pure combustible state
in the products of volcanic eruptions; for before
they reach the external surface, they must not only
be exposed to the air in the subterranean cavities,
but be propelled by steam; which must possess,
under the circumstances, at least the same facility of
oxidating them as air. Assuming the hypothesis
of the existence of such alloys of the metals of the
earths as may burn into lava in the interior, the
whole phenomena may be easily explained from the
action of the water of the sea and air on those
metals; nor is there any fact, or any of the circumstances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
which I have mentioned in the preceding
part of this paper, which cannot be easily explained
according to that hypothesis. For almost all the
volcanoes in the old world of considerable magnitude
are near, or at no considerable distance from
the sea: and if it be assumed that the first eruptions
are produced by the action of sea-water upon the
metals of the earths, and that considerable cavities
are left by the oxidated metals thrown out as lava,
the results of their action are such as might be anticipated;
for, after the first eruptions, the oxidations
which produce the subsequent ones may take place
in the caverns below the surface; and when the sea
is distant, as in the volcanoes of South America,
they may be supplied with water from great subterranean
lakes, as Humboldt states that some of them
throw up quantities of fish.</p>

<p>"On the hypothesis of a chemical cause for volcanic
fires, and reasoning from known facts, there
appears to me no other adequate source than the
oxidation of the metals which form the bases of the
earths and alkalies; but it must not be denied, that
considerations derived from thermometrical experiments
on the temperature of mines and of sources
of hot water, render it probable that the interior of
the globe possesses a very high temperature: and
the hypothesis of the nucleus of the globe being
composed of fluid matter offers a still more simple
solution of the phenomena of volcanic fires than that
which has been just developed."</p>

<p>It must be admitted that the concluding sentence
of this memoir is rather equivocal. He states that
the metalloidal theory of volcanoes is most chemical,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
but that the hypothesis which assumes the high
temperature of the interior of the globe is the most
simple; but he leaves us in doubt as to his own
belief upon the subject. In his "Last Days," however,
we shall find that he offers a less reserved
opinion upon this question.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>With respect to Sir Humphry Davy's last journey
to Rome, I have nothing of particular interest
to relate. Universally known and respected, a
member of almost every scientific society in Europe,
there was not a part of the Continent in which he
felt as a stranger in a foreign land. I might, in addition
to the circumstances which have been already
mentioned, relate several anecdotes in proof of the
widely-extended popularity which his genius and
discoveries had secured for him. The following
striking incidents deserve particular notice.&mdash;Whilst
sporting in Austria, he was assaulted by some peasants;
and the outrage was no sooner made known
to the Emperor, than he expressed his sorrow and
indignation in the strongest language, and immediately
directed that a party of troops should surround
the district, and a most rigorous search be
made for the culprits. The search was of course
successful, and the "Carinthian boors" received merited
chastisement.</p>

<p>For the following anecdote I am indebted to Lady
Davy. Her Ladyship was travelling alone, on account
of ill health, and upon arriving at Basle, she
naturally felt a strong desire to visit its far-famed
library; it so happened, however, that Sunday was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
the only day which afforded her this opportunity,
and so strictly is the sabbath observed at that place,
that she was at once informed that an admission to
the library, under any circumstances, was altogether
impossible. She nevertheless addressed a note to
the librarian, stating to him her name, and the reasons
for her unusual request. He immediately returned
an answer, and appointed the hour of ten
for her visit. Having shown her all that deserved
inspection, he concluded his attentions by saying,
"Madam, I have held the keys of this library for
thirty years, during which period only three persons
have been admitted to see its treasures on the Sunday;
two of these were crowned heads, the third the
wife of the most celebrated philosopher in Europe."</p>

<p>The following is the last letter which Davy ever
wrote to his much-valued friend Mr. Poole.&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">TO THOMAS POOLE, ESQ.</p>

<p class="date">Rome, Feb. 6, 1829.</p>

<p class="opening">MY DEAR POOLE,</p>

<p>I have not written to you during my absence
from England, because I had no satisfactory account
of any marked progress towards health to give
you, and the feelings of an invalid are painful
enough for himself, and should, I think, never form
a part of his correspondence; for they are not diminished
by the conviction that they are felt by
others. Would I were better! I would then write
to you an agreeable letter from this glorious city;
but I am here <em>wearing away</em> the winter; a ruin
amongst ruins! I am anxious to hear from you,&mdash;very
anxious, so pray write to me with this address,
"Sir H. Davy, Inglese, posta restanti, Rovigo,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
Italia." You know you must pay the postage to
the frontier, otherwise the letters, like one a friend
sent to me, will go back to you. Pray be so good
as to be particular in the direction,&mdash;the "Inglese"
is necessary. I hope you got a copy of my little
trifle "<em>Salmonia</em>." I ordered copies to be sent to
you, to Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, and to Mr. Baker: but as the
course of letters in foreign countries is uncertain, I
am not sure you received them; if not, you will
have lost little; a <em>second edition</em> will soon be out,
which will be in every respect more worthy of your
perusal, being, I think, twice (not saying much for
it) as entertaining and philosophical. I will take
care by early orders that you have this book. I
write and philosophize a good deal, and have nearly
finished a work with a higher aim than the little
book I speak of above, and which I shall dedicate
to you. It contains the essence of my philosophical
opinions, and some of my poetical reveries. It is,
like the "Salmonia," an amusement of my sickness;
but "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">paulo majora canamus</i>." I sometimes think of
the lines of Waller, and seem to feel their truth:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"The soul's dark cottage, batter`d and decay'd,</div>
<div class="line i0h">Lets in new lights through chinks that Time has made."</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I have, notwithstanding my infirmities, attended
to scientific objects whenever it was in my power,
and I have sent the Royal Society a paper which
they will publish, on the peculiar Electricity of the
Torpedo, which I think bears remotely upon the functions
of life. I attend a good deal to Natural History,
and I think I have recognised in the Mediterranean
a <em>new species of eel</em>, a sort of link between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
the conger and the muræna of the ancients. I have
no doubt Mr. Baker is right about the distinction
between the conger and the common eel. I am
very anxious to hear what he thinks about <em>their generation</em>.
Pray get from him a distinct opinion on
this subject. I am at this moment getting the <em>eels
in the markets</em> here dissected, and have found <em>ova</em> in
plenty. Pray tell me particularly what Mr. Baker
has done; this is a favourite subject with me, and
you can give me no news so interesting. My dear
friend, I shall never forget your kindness to me.
You, with one other person, have given me the little
happiness I have enjoyed since my severe visitation.</p>

<p>I fight against sickness and fate, believing I have
still duties to perform, and that even my illness is
connected in some way with my being made useful
to my fellow-creatures. I have this conviction full
on my mind, that intellectual beings spring from
the same breath of Infinite Intelligence, and return
to it again, but by different courses. Like rivers,
born amidst the clouds of heaven, and lost in the
deep and eternal ocean&mdash;some in youth, rapid and
short-lived torrents; some in manhood, powerful
and copious rivers; and some in age, by a winding
and slow course, half lost in their career, and making
their exit through many sandy and shallow mouths.
I hope to be at Rovigo about the first week in
April. I travel slowly and with my own horses.
If you will come and join me there, I can give you
a place in a comfortable carriage, and can show you
the most glorious country in Europe&mdash;Illyria and
Styria, and take you to the French frontier before
the beginning of autumn,&mdash;perhaps to England. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
you can come, do so at once. I have two servants,
and can accommodate you with every thing. I
think of taking some baths before I return, in
Upper Austria; but I write as if I were a strong
man, when I am like a pendulum, as it were,
swinging between death and life.</p>

<p class="signature">God bless you, my dear Poole.<br />
<span class="j2">Your grateful and affectionate friend,</span><br />
<span class="smcap j10">H. Davy</span>.</p>

<p class="j2">Pray remember me to our friends at Stowey.</p>

</div>

<p>His paper on the Electricity of the Torpedo, to
which he alludes in the foregoing letter, appears to
have been written shortly after he had finished his
"Salmonia," as it is dated from Lubiana, Illyria, on
the 24th of October, and it was read before the
Royal Society on the 20th of November 1828, and
published in the first part of the Transactions for
1829. It will be remembered, that this subject had
long engaged his attention; and he expresses his
surprise that the electricity of living animals should
not have been an object of greater attention, both on
account of its physiological importance, and its general
relation to the science of electro-chemistry.</p>

<p>When Volta discovered his wonderful pile, he
imagined he had made a perfect resemblance of the
organ of the Gymnotus and Torpedo; and Davy
observes, that whoever has felt the shocks of the
natural and artificial instruments must have been
convinced, as far as sensation is concerned, of their
strict analogy.</p>

<p>After the discovery of the <em>chemical</em> power of the
Voltaic instrument, he was naturally desirous of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
ascertaining whether this property was possessed by
the electrical organs of living animals; for which
purpose, he instituted various experiments, but he
could not discover that such was the fact. Upon
mentioning his researches to Signor Volta, with whom
he passed some time in the summer of 1815, the Italian
philosopher showed him a peculiar form of his
instrument, which appeared to fulfil the conditions of
the organs of the torpedo; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i> a pile, of which the
fluid substance was a very imperfect conductor,
such as honey or a strong saccharine extract, which
required a certain time to become charged, and
which did not decompose water, though it communicated
weak shocks.</p>

<p>The discovery by Oersted of the effects of Voltaic
electricity on the magnetic needle induced
Davy to examine whether the electricity of living
animals possessed a similar power. Having, after
some trouble, procured two lively and recently
caught Torpedoes, he passed the shocks from the
largest of these animals a number of times through
the circuit of an extremely delicate magnetic electrometer,
but, although every precaution was used,
not the slightest deviation of, or effect on, the
needle could be perceived.</p>

<p>"These negative results," says he, "may be explained
by supposing that the motion of the electricity
in the torpedinal organ is in no measurable
time, and that a current of some continuance is necessary
to produce the deviation of the magnetic
needle; and I found that the magnetic electrometer
was equally insensible to the weak discharge of a
Leyden jar as to that of the torpedinal organ;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
though whenever there was a continuous current
from the smallest surfaces in Voltaic combinations
of the weakest power, but in which some chemical
action was going on, it was instantly and powerfully
affected. Two series of zinc and silver, and paper
moistened in salt and water, caused the permanent
deviation of the needle several degrees, though the
plates of zinc were only one-sixth of an inch in
diameter.</p>

<p>"It would be desirable to pursue these enquiries
with the electricity of the Gymnotus, which is so
much more powerful than that of the Torpedo; but
if they are now to be reasoned upon, they seem to
show a stronger analogy between common and animal
electricity, than between Voltaic and animal
electricity; it is however, I think, more probable
that animal electricity will be found of a distinctive
and peculiar kind.</p>

<p>"Common electricity is excited upon non-conductors,
and is readily carried off by conductors and
imperfect conductors. Voltaic electricity is excited
upon combinations of perfect and imperfect conductors,
and is only transmitted by perfect conductors,
or imperfect conductors of the best kind.</p>

<p>"Magnetism, if it be a form of electricity, belongs
only to perfect conductors; and, in its modifications,
to a peculiar class of them.</p>

<p>"The animal electricity resides only in the imperfect
conductors forming the organs of living
animals, and its object in the economy of nature is
to act on living animals.</p>

<p>"Distinctions might be established in pursuing
the various modifications or properties of electricity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
in these different forms; but it is scarcely possible
to avoid being struck by another relation of this
subject. The torpedinal organ depends for its
powers upon the will of the animal. John Hunter
has shown how copiously it is furnished with nerves.
In examining the columnar structure of the organ
of the Torpedo, I have never been able to discover
arrangements of different conductors similar to those
in galvanic combinations, and it seems not improbable
that the shock depends upon some property
developed by the action of the nerves.</p>

<p>"To attempt to reason upon any phenomena of
this kind as dependent upon a specific fluid would
be wholly vain. Little as we know of the nature
of electrical action, we are still more ignorant of the
nature of the functions of the nerves. There seems,
however, a gleam of light worth pursuing in the peculiarities
of animal electricity,&mdash;its connexion with
so large a nervous system, its dependence upon the
will of the animal, and the instantaneous nature of its
transfer, which may lead, when pursued by adequate
enquirers, to results important for physiology."</p>

<p>He concludes this paper by expressing his fear
that the weak state of his health will prevent him
from following the subject with the attention it
seems to deserve; and he therefore communicates
these imperfect trials to the Royal Society, in the
hope that they may lead to more extensive and profound
researches.</p>

<p>We come now to the consideration of the last
production of his genius&mdash;"Consolations in Travel,
or the Last Days of a Philosopher:" A work which,
he informs us in the preface, was composed immediately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
after Salmonia, under the same unfavourable
and painful circumstances, and at a period when his
constitution suffered from new attacks. From this
exercise of the mind, he tells us, that he derived
some pleasure and some consolation, when most
other sources of consolation and pleasure were
closed to him; and he ventures to hope that those
hours of sickness may be not altogether unprofitable
to persons in perfect health. His brother, Dr.
Davy, who edited the work after the decease of Sir
Humphry, informs us that it was concluded at the
very moment of the invasion of the author's last
illness, and that, had his life been prolonged, it is
probable some additions and some changes would
have been made.</p>

<p>"The characters of the persons of the dialogue,"
continues the Editor, "were intended to be ideal, at
least in great part;&mdash;such they should be considered
by the reader; and it is to be hoped, that the incidents
introduced, as well as the persons, will be
viewed only as subordinate and subservient to the
sentiments and the doctrines. The dedication, it
may be specially noticed, is the Author's own, and in
the very words dictated by himself at a time when
he had lost the power of writing, except with
extreme difficulty, owing to the paralytic attack,
although he retained in a very remarkable manner
all his mental faculties unimpaired and unclouded."
The words of the Dedication are "<span class="smcap">To Thomas
Poole, Esq.</span> of Nether Stowey; in remembrance
of thirty years of continued and faithful friendship."</p>

<p>This is a most extraordinary and interesting work:
extraordinary, not only from the wild strength of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
fancy, and the extravagance of its conceptions, but
from the bright light of scientific truth which is constantly
shining through its metaphorical tissue, and
irradiating its most shadowy imaginings. It may
be compared to the tree of the lower regions in the
Æneid, to every leaf of which was attached a dream;
and yet, however wildly his fancy may dream, his
philosophy never sleeps; and in his exit from the
land of phantoms, the author can in no instance be
accused of having mistaken the gate of ivory for
that of horn. To the biographer, the work is of
the highest interest and value, by confirming, in a
remarkable manner, the opinion so frequently expressed
in the course of these memoirs, with respect
to the diversified talents of Sir Humphry Davy;
and above all, by elucidating that rare combination
of imagination with judgment, which imparted to
his genius its more striking peculiarities.</p>

<p>The work consists of six Dialogues:&mdash;<span class="smcap">1. The
Vision; 2. Discussions connected with the
Vision in the Colosæum; 3. The Unknown;
4. The Proteus, or Immortality; 5. The Chemical
Philosopher</span>; and <span class="smcap">6. Pola, or Time</span>.</p>

<p>The interlocutors of the first dialogue are two intellectual
Englishmen, one of whom the author calls
<em>Ambrosio</em>; a man of highly cultivated taste, great
classical erudition, and minute historical knowledge:
a Catholic in religion, but so liberal in his sentiments,
that in another age he might have been
secretary to Ganganelli. The other friend, whom
he calls <em>Onuphrio</em>, was a man of a very different
character: belonging to the English aristocracy, he
had some of the prejudices usually attached to birth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
and rank; but his manners were gentle, his temper
good, and his disposition amiable. Having been
partly educated at a northern university in Britain,
he had adopted views in religion which went even
beyond toleration, and which might be regarded as
entering the verge of scepticism. For a patrician,
he was very liberal in his political views. His
imagination was poetical and discursive, his taste
good, and his tact extremely fine,&mdash;so exquisite, indeed,
that it sometimes approached to morbid sensibility,
and disgusted him with slight defects, and
made him keenly sensible of small perfections to
which common minds have been indifferent.</p>

<p>The author, with these his two friends, makes an
excursion to the Colosæum, and the conversation,
which a view of those magnificent ruins produced,
together with the account of a dream, or vision,
which occurred to him while left alone amidst these
mouldering monuments, forms the subject-matter
of the first dialogue. It is impossible for any person
of the least imagination to contemplate this
decay of former magnificence without strong emotion;
but the direction and tone of such feeling will
be necessarily modified by the qualities of the mind
in which it is excited; and the author has therefore
very properly assigned to each of the <em>dramatis personæ</em>,
such opinions as might best correspond with
his character and temperament.</p>

<p>They are all represented as being struck with the
transiency of human monuments; but <em>Ambrosio</em>
views with triumph the sanctifying influence of a
few crosses planted around the ruins, in arresting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
the farther decay of the pile. "Without the influence
of Christianity," he exclaims, "these majestic
ruins would have been dispersed or levelled to the
dust. Plundered of their lead and iron by the barbarians,
Goths and Vandals, and robbed even of
their stones by Roman princes&mdash;the Barberini, they
owe what remains of their relics to the sanctifying
influence of that faith which has preserved for the
world all that was worth preserving, not merely arts
and literature, but likewise that which constitutes
the progressive nature of intellect, and the institutions
which afford to us happiness in this world, and
hopes of a blessed immortality in the next." And
he continues,&mdash;"What a contrast the present application
of this building, connected with holy feelings
and exalted hopes, is to that of the ancient one, when
it was used for exhibiting to the Roman people the
destruction of men by wild beasts, or of men more
savage than wild beasts by each other, to gratify a
horrible appetite for cruelty, founded upon a still
more detestable lust, that of universal domination!
And who would have supposed, in the time of Titus,
that a faith, despised in its insignificant origin, and
persecuted from the supposed obscurity of its founder
and its principles, should have reared a dome to the
memory of one of its humblest teachers, more glorious
than was ever framed for Jupiter or Apollo in
the ancient world, and have preserved even the ruins
of the temples of the Pagan deities, and have burst
forth in splendour and majesty, consecrating truth
amidst the shrines of error, employing the idols of
the Roman superstition for the most holy purposes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
and rising a bright and constant light amidst the
dark and starless night which followed the destruction
of the Roman empire!"</p>

<p>It was not to be expected that <em>Onuphrio</em>, whose
views are represented as verging upon scepticism,
should have tacitly coincided in these opinions of
<em>Ambrosio</em>. He admits, indeed, that some little of
the perfect state in which these ruins exist may have
been owing to the causes just described; but these
causes, he maintains, have only lately begun to
operate, and the mischief was done before Christianity
was established at Rome. "Feeling differently
on these subjects," says he, "I admire this
venerable ruin rather as the record of the destruction
of the power of the greatest people that ever
existed, than as a proof of the triumph of Christianity;
and I am carried forward, in melancholy anticipation,
to the period when even the magnificent
dome of St. Peter's will be in a similar state to that
in which the Colosæum now is, and when its ruins
may be preserved by the sanctifying influence of
some new and unknown faith; when perhaps the
statue of Jupiter, which at present receives the kiss
of the devotee, as the image of St. Peter, may be
employed for another holy use, as the personification
of a future saint or divinity; and when the monuments
of the Papal magnificence shall be mixed
with the same dust as that which now covers the
tombs of the Cæsars.</p>

<p>"Such, I am sorry to say, is the general history
of all the works and institutions belonging to humanity.
They rise, flourish, and then decay and
fall; and the period of their decline is generally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
proportional to that of their elevation. In ancient
Thebes or Memphis, the peculiar genius of the
people has left us monuments from which we can
judge of their arts, though we cannot understand
the nature of their superstitions. Of Babylon and of
Troy, the remains are almost extinct; and what
we know of those famous cities is almost entirely
derived from literary records. Ancient Greece and
Rome we view in the few remains of their monuments;
and the time will arrive when modern
Rome shall be what ancient Rome now is; and
ancient Rome and Athens will be what Tyre or
Carthage now are, known only by coloured dust in
the desert, or coloured sand, containing the fragments
of bricks, or glass, washed up by the wave of
a stormy sea."</p>

<p>For this desponding view of passing events,
<em>Onuphrio</em> finds consolation in the evidences of revealed
religion. In the origin, progress, elevation,
decline, and fall of the empires of antiquity, he sees
proofs that they were intended for a definite end in
the scheme of human redemption; and he finds prophecies
which have been amply verified. He regards
the foundation or the ruin of a kingdom, which
appears in civil history so great an event, as comparatively
of small moment in the history of man
and in his religious institutions. He considers the
establishment of the worship of one God amongst
a despised and contemned people, as the most important
circumstance in the history of the early
world. He regards the Christian dispensation as
naturally arising out of the Jewish, and the doctrines
of the Pagan nations all preparatory to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
triumph and final establishment of a creed fitted for
the most enlightened state of the human mind, and
equally adapted to every climate and every people."</p>

<p>We cannot but regard these passages with great
interest, as indicating the train of thought which
must have occupied the mind of their author, and
as proving that, in his latter days, he not only studied
the doctrines of Christianity, but derived the
greatest consolation from its tenets.</p>

<p>After some farther conversation, <em>Onuphrio</em> and
<em>Ambrosio</em> leave their friend the author to pursue his
meditations amidst the solitude of the ruins.</p>

<p>Seated in the moonshine on one of the steps leading
to the seats supposed to have been occupied by
the patricians in the Colosæum at the time of the
public games, the train of ideas in which he had
before indulged continued to flow with a vividness
and force increased by the stillness and solitude of
the scene, and by the full moon, which, he observes,
has always a peculiar effect on these moods of feeling
in his mind, giving to them a wildness and a
kind of indefinite sensation, such as he supposes
belong at all times to the true poetical temperament.</p>

<p>"It must be so," thought he, "no new city will
rise again out of the double ruins of this; no new
empire will be founded upon these colossal remains
of that of the old Romans. The world, like the
individual, flourishes in youth, rises to strength in
manhood, falls into decay in age; and the ruins of
an empire are like the decrepid frame of an individual,
except that they have some tints of beauty,
which nature bestows upon them. The sun of
civilization arose in the East, advanced towards the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
West, and is now at its meridian; in a few centuries
more, it will probably be seen sinking below
the horizon, even in the new world; and there will
be left darkness only where there is a bright light,
deserts of sand where there were populous cities,
and stagnant morasses where the green meadow, or
the bright corn-field once appeared. Time," he exclaimed,
"which purifies, and, as it were, sanctifies
the mind, destroys and brings into utter decay the
body; and even in nature its influence seems always
degrading. She is represented by the poet as
eternal in her youth; but amongst these ruins she
appears to me eternal in her age, and here, no traces
of renovation appear in the ancient of days."</p>

<p>He had scarcely concluded this ideal sentence,
when his reverie became deeper, and his imagination
called up a spirit, who, having rebuked him
for his ignorance and presumption, undeceives him
in his views of the history of the world, by unfolding
to him in a vision the progress of man from a
state of barbarity to that of high civilization. He
is first shown a country covered with forests and
marshes; wild animals were grazing in large savannahs,
and carnivorous beasts, such as lions and tigers,
occasionally disturbing and destroying them. Man
appeared as a naked savage, feeding upon wild fruits,
or devouring shell-fish, or fighting with clubs for
the remains of a whale which had been thrown upon
the shore. His habitation was a cave in the earth&mdash;"See
the birth of Time!" exclaimed the Genius;
"look at man in his newly-created state, full of
youth and vigour. Do you see aught in this state
to admire or envy?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
In the next scene, a country opened upon his view,
which appeared partly wild and partly cultivated;
and men were seen covered with the skins of animals,
and driving cattle to enclosed pastures; others
were reaping and collecting corn, and others again
were making it into bread. Cottages appeared furnished
with many of the conveniences of life. The
Genius now said, "Look at these groups of men
who are escaped from the state of infancy; they
owe their improvement to a few superior minds still
amongst them. That aged man whom you see with
a crowd around him taught them to build cottages;
from that other they learnt to domesticate cattle;
from others, to collect and sow corn and seeds of
fruit. And these arts will never be lost; another
generation will see them more perfect. You shall
be shown other visions of the passages of time;
but as you are carried along the stream which flows
from the period of creation to the present moment,
I shall only arrest your transit to make you observe
some circumstances which will demonstrate the
truths I wish you to know." He then proceeds to
describe in succession the different scenes as they
appeared before him, and to relate the observations
by which his genius, or intellectual guide, accompanied
him.</p>

<p>A great extent of cultivated plains, large cities on
the sea-shore, palaces, forums, and temples, were
displayed before him. He saw men associated in
groups, mounted on horses, and performing military
exercises; galleys moved by oars on the ocean;
roads intersecting the country covered with travellers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
and containing carriages moved by men or
horses. The Genius now said, "You see the early
state of civilization of man: the cottages of the last
race you beheld have become improved into stately
dwellings, palaces, and temples, in which use is
combined with ornament. The few men to whom,
as I said before, the foundations of these improvements
were owing, have had divine honours paid to
their memory. But look at the instruments belonging
to this generation, and you will find they were
only of brass. You see men who are talking to
crowds around them, and others who are apparently
amusing listening groups by a kind of song or recitation;
these are the earliest bards and orators; but
all their signs of thought are oral, for written language
does not yet exist."</p>

<p>The Genius next presented to him a scene of
varied business and imagery. He saw a man who
bore in his hands the same instruments as our modern
smiths, presenting a vase, which appeared to be
made of iron, amidst the acclamations of an assembled
multitude; and he saw in the same place men
who carried rolls of papyrus in their hands, and
wrote upon them with reeds containing ink, made
from the soot of wood mixed with a solution of
glue.&mdash;"See," the Genius said, "an immense change
produced in the condition of society by the two
arts of which you now see the origin; the one, that
of rendering iron malleable, which is owing to a
single individual, an obscure Greek; the other, that
of making thought permanent in written characters,&mdash;an
art which has gradually arisen from the hieroglyphics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
which you may observe on yonder pyramids.
You will now see human life more replete
with power and activity."</p>

<p>In the scenes that succeeded, he saw bronze instruments
thrown away; malleable iron converted
into hard steel, and applied to a thousand purposes
of civilized life; bands of men traversing the sea,
founding colonies, building cities, and, wherever
they established themselves, carrying with them
their peculiar arts. He saw the Roman world
succeeded by cities filled with an idle and luxurious
population, and the farms which had been cultivated
by warriors, who left the plough to take the command
of armies, now in the hands of slaves; and the
militia of free men supplanted by bands of mercenaries,
who sold the Empire to the highest bidder.
He saw immense masses of warriors collecting in
the North and East, carrying with them no other
proofs of cultivation but their horses and steel arms.
He saw these savages every where plundering cities
and destroying the monuments of arts and literature.
Ruin, desolation, and darkness were before him, and
he closed his eyes to avoid the melancholy scene.
"See," said the Genius, "the termination of a
power believed by its founders invincible, and intended
to be eternal. But you will find, though
the glory and greatness belonging to its military
genius have passed away, yet those belonging to
the arts and institutions by which it adorned and
dignified life, will again arise in another state of
society."</p>

<p>Upon again opening his eyes, he saw Italy recovering
from her desolation, towns arising with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
governments almost upon the model of ancient
Athens and Rome, and these different small states
rivals in arts and arms;&mdash;he saw the remains of
libraries, which had been preserved in monasteries
and churches by a holy influence, which even the
Goth and Vandal respected, again opened to the
people;&mdash;he saw Rome rising from her ashes, the
fragments of statues found amidst the ruins of her
palaces and imperial villas, becoming the models for
the regeneration of art;&mdash;he saw magnificent temples
raised in this city, become the metropolis of a
new and Christian world, and ornamented with the
most brilliant master-pieces of the arts of design.&mdash;"Now,"
the Genius said, "society has taken its
modern and permanent aspect. Consider for a
moment its relations to letters and to arms, as
contrasted with those of the ancient world." He
looked, and he saw that, in the place of the rolls of
papyrus, libraries were now filled with books. "Behold,"
the Genius said, "<span class="smcap">The Printing Press</span>!
By the invention of Faust, the productions of
genius are, as it were, made imperishable, capable
of indefinite multiplication, and rendered an unalienable
heritage of the human mind. By this art,
apparently so humble, the progress of society is
secured, and man is spared the humiliation of witnessing
again scenes like those which followed the
destruction of the Roman Empire. Now look to
the warriors of modern times; you see the spear, the
javelin, and the cuirass are changed for the musket
and the light artillery. The German monk who
discovered gunpowder did not meanly affect the
destinies of mankind; wars are become less bloody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
by becoming less personal; mere brutal strength is
rendered of comparatively little avail; all the resources
of civilization are required to move a large
army; wealth, ingenuity, and perseverance become
the principal elements of success; civilized man is
rendered in consequence infinitely superior to the
savage, and gunpowder gives permanence to his
triumph, and secures the cultivated nations from
being ever again overrun by the inroads of millions
of barbarians."<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>The Genius then directs his attention to scenes
in which are displayed the triumphs of modern
science; such as the steam-engine, and the thousand
resources furnished by the chemical and mechanical
arts; and she concludes by endeavouring to impress
upon him the conviction, "That the results of intellectual
labour, or of scientific genius, are permanent,
and incapable of being lost. Monarchs change their
plans, governments their objects, a fleet or an army
effect their purpose and then pass away; but a piece
of steel touched by the magnet preserves its character
for ever, and secures to man the dominion of
the trackless ocean. A new period of society may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
send armies from the shores of the Baltic to those of
the Euxine, and the empire of the followers of Mahomet
may be broken in pieces by a Northern people,
and the dominion of the Britons in Asia may
share the fate of Tamerlane or Zengis-khan; but the
steam-boat which ascends the Delaware, or the St.
Lawrence, will be continued to be used, and will
carry the civilization of an improved people into the
deserts of North America, and into the wilds of
Canada. In the common history of the world, as
compiled by authors in general, almost all the great
changes of nations are confounded with changes in
their dynasties, and events are usually referred either
to sovereigns, chiefs, heroes, or their armies, which
do, in fact, originate from entirely different causes,
either of an intellectual or moral nature."</p>

<p>Having instructed him in the history of man as
an inhabitant of the earth, the Genius proceeds to
reveal to him the mysteries of spiritual natures, in
which the author evidently shows his attachment to
the belief that our intellectual essence is destined
hereafter to enjoy a higher and better state of planetary
existence,<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> drinking intellectual light from a
purer source, and approaching nearer to the Infinite
and Divine mind. I shall not attempt to follow
him and his Genius to the verge of the solar system,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
witnessing in his career the inhabitants of planets
and comets. We may upon this occasion truly
apply to the author the words of Lucretius&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="line">"Processit longe flammantia m&oelig;nia mundi."</div>
</div>

<div class="line i0h">Beyond the flaming limits of the world."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Creech.</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the former part of the dialogue, his poetical coruscations
appeared only as brilliant sparks thrown
off by the rapidity of the machinery which he
worked for a useful end and for a definite purpose;
his vivid imagination may now be compared to a
display of fire-works, which dazzle and confound
without enlightening the senses, and leave the spectator
in still more profound darkness.</p>

<p>His <span class="smcap">Second Dialogue</span>, entitled "Discussions
connected with the Vision in the Colosæum," may
be considered as a commentary upon the views he
had unfolded; and a more appropriate spot, perhaps,
could not have been selected for a conversation
upon the progress of civilization, than the summit
of Vesuvius, from which, to adopt the language
of <em>Ambrosio</em>, "We see not only the power and
activity of man as existing at present, and of which
the highest example may be represented by the
steam-boat departing from Palermo, but we may
likewise view scenes which carry us into the very
bosom of antiquity, and as it were make us live
with the generations of past ages."</p>

<p>The author, who assumes throughout this dialogue
the name of <em>Philalethes</em>, after having been
duly rallied by his friends on the subject of his
vision, thus expresses himself:&mdash;"I will acknowledge
that the vision in the Colosæum is a fiction;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
but the most important parts of it really occurred to
me in sleep, particularly that in which I seemed to
leave the earth and launch into the infinity of space,
under the guidance of a tutelary genius. And the
origin and progress of civil society form likewise
parts of another dream which I had many years
ago; and it was in the reverie which happened
when you quitted me in the Colosæum, that I wove
all these thoughts together, and gave them the form
in which I narrated them to you.&mdash;I do not say that
they are strictly to be considered as an accurate representation
of my waking thoughts; for I am not
quite convinced that dreams are always the representations
of the state of the mind, modified by
organic diseases or by associations. There are certainly
no absolutely new ideas produced in sleep;
yet I have had more than one instance, in the course
of my life, of most extraordinary combinations occurring
in this state, which have had considerable influence
on my feelings, my imagination, and my
health."</p>

<p><em>Philalethes</em> now relates a fact to which his preceding
observation more immediately referred; he
anticipates unbelief,&mdash;but he declares that he mentions
nothing but a simple fact.</p>

<p>"Almost a quarter of a century ago, I contracted
that terrible form of typhus fever known by the name
of jail fever,&mdash;I may say, not from any imprudence
of my own, but whilst engaged in putting in execution
a plan for ventilating one of the great prisons
of the metropolis.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> My illness was severe and dangerous;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
as long as the fever continued, my dreams
and deliriums were most painful and oppressive;
but when weakness consequent to exhaustion came
on, and when the probability of death seemed to my
physicians greater than that of life, there was an
entire change in all my ideal combinations. I remained
in an apparently senseless or lethargic state,
but, in fact, my mind was peculiarly active; there
was always before me the form of a beautiful
woman, with whom I was engaged in the most interesting
and intellectual conversation."</p>

<p><em>Ambrosio</em> and <em>Onuphrio</em> very naturally suggest
that this could have been no other than the image
of some favourite maiden which had haunted his
imagination; but <em>Philalethes</em> rejects with indignation
such an explanation of the vision. "I will not," he
exclaims, "allow you to treat me with ridicule on
this point, till you have heard the second part of
my tale. Ten years after I had recovered from the
fever, and when I had almost lost the recollection of
the vision, it was recalled to my memory by a very
blooming and graceful maiden fourteen or fifteen
years old, that I accidentally met during my travels
in Illyria; but I cannot say that the impression
made upon my mind by this female was very strong.
Now comes the extraordinary part of the narrative:
ten years after,&mdash;twenty years after my first illness,
at a time when I was exceedingly weak from a
severe and dangerous malady, which for many years
threatened my life, and when my mind was almost
in a desponding state, being in a course of travels
ordered by my medical advisers, I again met the
person who was the representative of my visionary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
female; and to her kindness and care, I believe, I
owe what remains to me of existence. My despondency
gradually disappeared, and though my health
still continued weak, life began to possess charms
for me which I had thought were for ever gone;
and I could not help identifying the living angel
with the vision which appeared as my guardian
genius during the illness of my youth."</p>

<p>The reader will probably agree with <em>Onuphrio</em>, in
seeing in this history nothing beyond the influence
of an imagination excited by disease.</p>

<p>The discourse now turns upon that part of the
vision in the Colosæum in which was exhibited the
early state of man, after his first creation, and which
<em>Ambrosio</em> considers as not only incompatible with
revelation, but likewise with reason and every thing
that we know respecting the history or traditions of
the early nations of antiquity.</p>

<p>I shall merely state the objection which <em>Ambrosio</em>
offers. I must then refer the reader to the work
itself for an account of the discussion it provoked.</p>

<p>"<em>Ambrosio.</em>&mdash;You consider man, in his early state,
a savage like those who now inhabit New Holland,
or New Zealand, acquiring, by the little use that
they make of a feeble reason, the power of supporting
and extending life. Now, I contend that, if
man had been so created, he must inevitably have
been destroyed by the elements, or devoured by
savage beasts, so infinitely his superiors in physical
force."</p>

<p>During the discussion, an opinion is advanced by
<em>Ambrosio</em>, so singular, that I must be allowed to
quote it. "I consider," says he, "all the miraculous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
parts of our religion as effected by changes in the
sensations or ideas of the human mind, and not by
physical changes in the order of nature! To Infinite
Wisdom and Power, a change in the intellectual
state of the human being may be the result of a
momentary will, and the mere act of faith may
produce the change. How great the powers of
imagination are, even in ordinary life, is shown by
many striking facts, and nothing seems impossible
to this imagination when acted upon by Divine
influence."</p>

<p>This is surely a most extraordinary line of argument
for the apologist of the Christian faith, and of
the miracles by which it is supported.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Third Dialogue</span>, called the Unknown,
the author and his friends, <em>Ambrosio</em> and <em>Onuphrio</em>,
make an excursion to the remains of the temples of
Pæstum. "Were my existence to be prolonged
through ten centuries," exclaims the author, "I
think I could never forget the pleasure I received
on that delicious spot." In contemplating beautiful
scenery, much of its interest depends upon the feelings
and associations of the moment; and the author
was upon this occasion evidently in that poetical
frame of mind which sheds a magic light over every
landscape, and converts the most ordinary objects
into emblems of morality: in the admixture of the
olive and the cypress tree, he saw a connection, to
memorialize, as it were, how near each other are life
and death, joy and sorrow; while the music of the
birds, and, above all, the cooing of the turtle-doves,
by overpowering the murmuring of the waves and
the whistling of the winds, served but to show him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
that, in the strife of nature, the voice of love is
predominant.</p>

<p>With their hearts touched by the scene they had
witnessed, the travellers descended to the ruins, and
began to examine those wonderful remains which
have outlived even the name of the people by whom
they were raised. While engaged in measuring the
Doric columns in the interior of the Temple of
Neptune, a stranger, remarkable both in dress
and appearance, was observed to be writing in a
memorandum book; the author immediately addresses
him, and becoming mutually pleased with
each other, they enter into a conversation of high
scientific interest.</p>

<p>The sentiments delivered by the "<span class="smcap">Unknown</span>," for
by this title is the philosopher designated, notwithstanding
their dramatic dress, are evidently to be
received as the bequest of the latest scientific opinions
of Sir H. Davy upon several important subjects,
and must consequently command our respect
and consideration.</p>

<p>To a question relative to the nature of the masses
of travertine, of which the ruins consisted, the Unknown
replied, that they were certainly produced
by deposition from water; and he rather believed,
that a lake in the immediate neighbourhood of the
city furnished the quarry. The party are then
described as visiting this spot.</p>

<p>"There was something peculiarly melancholy in
the character of this water; all the herbs around it
were grey, as if incrusted with marble; a few buffaloes
were slaking their thirst in it, which ran
wildly away at our approach, and appeared to retire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
into a rocky excavation or quarry at the end of the
lake. 'There,' said the stranger, 'is what I believe
to be the source of those large and durable stones
which you see in the plain before you. This water
rapidly deposits calcareous matter, and even, if you
throw a stick into it, a few hours is sufficient to give
it a coating of this substance. Whichever way you
turn your eyes, you see masses of this recently produced
marble, the consequence of the overflowing
of the lake during the winter floods.'</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>"This water is like many, I may say most, of the
sources which rise at the foot of the Apennines; it
holds carbonic acid in solution, which has dissolved
a portion of the calcareous matter of the rock through
which it has passed:&mdash;this carbonic acid is dissipated
in the atmosphere, and the marble, slowly thrown
down, assumes a crystalline form, and produces coherent
stones. The lake before us is not particularly
rich in the quantity of calcareous matter, for,
as I have found by experience, a pint of it does not
afford more than five or six grains; but the quantity
of fluid and the length of time are sufficient to account
for the immense quantities of tufa and rock
which, in the course of ages, have accumulated in
this situation.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>"It can, I think, be scarcely doubted that there
is a source of volcanic fire at no great distance from
the surface, in the whole of southern Italy; and,
this fire acting upon the calcareous rocks of which
the Apennines are composed, must constantly detach
from them carbonic acid, which rising to the sources
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
of the springs, deposited from the waters of the
atmosphere, must give them their impregnation, and
enable them to dissolve calcareous matter. I need
not dwell upon Ætna, Vesuvius, or the Lipari
Islands, to prove that volcanic fires are still in existence;
and there can be no doubt that, in earlier
periods, almost the whole of Italy was ravaged by
them; even Rome itself, the eternal city, rests upon
the craters of extinct volcanoes; and I imagine that
the traditional and fabulous record of the destruction
made by the conflagration of Phaeton, in the chariot
of the Sun, and his falling into the Po, had reference
to a great and tremendous igneous volcanic eruption
which extended over Italy, and ceased only near the
Po, at the foot of the Alps. Be this as it may, the
sources of carbonic acid are numerous, not merely
in the Neapolitan but likewise in the Roman and
Tuscan states. The most magnificent waterfall in
Europe, that of the Velino near Terni, is partly fed
by a stream containing calcareous matter dissolved
by carbonic acid, and it deposits marble, which crystallizes
even in the midst of its thundering descent
and foam, in the bed in which it falls.</p>

<p>"There is a lake in Latium, a few yards above
the Lacus Albula, where the ancient Romans erected
their baths, which sends down a considerable
stream of tepid water to the larger lake; but this
water is less strongly impregnated with carbonic
acid; the largest lake is actually a saturated solution
of this gas, which escapes from it in such quantities
in some parts of its surface, that it has the appearance
of being actually in ebullition. Its temperature
I ascertained to be, in the winter, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
warmest parts, above 80 degrees of Fahrenheit, and
as it appears to be pretty constant, it must be supplied
with heat from a subterraneous source, being
nearly twenty degrees above the mean temperature
of the atmosphere. Kircher has detailed, in his
<em>Mundus Subterraneus</em>, various wonders respecting
this lake, most of which are unfounded; such as,
that it is unfathomable,&mdash;that it has at the bottom
the heat of boiling water, and that floating islands
rise from the gulf which emits it. It must certainly
be very difficult, or even impossible, to fathom
a source which rises with so much violence
from a subterraneous excavation; and at a time
when chemistry had made small progress, it was
easy to mistake the disengagement of carbonic acid
for an actual ebullition. The floating islands are
real; but neither the Jesuit, nor any of the writers
who have since described this lake, had a correct
idea of their origin, which is exceedingly curious.
The high temperature of this water, and the quantity
of carbonic acid that it contains, render it peculiarly
fitted to afford a pabulum or nourishment
to vegetable life; the banks of travertine are every
where covered with reeds, lichens, confervæ, and various
kinds of aquatic vegetables; and at the same
time that the process of vegetable life is going on,
the crystallizations of the calcareous matter, which
is every where deposited in consequence of the
escape of carbonic acid, likewise proceed, giving a
constant milkiness to what from its tint would otherwise
be a blue fluid. So rapid is the vegetation,
owing to the decomposition of the carbonic acid,
that even in winter, masses of confervæ and lichens,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
mixed with deposited travertine, are constantly detached
by the current of water from the bank, and
float down the stream, which being a considerable
river, is never without many of these small islands
on its surface; they are sometimes only a few
inches in size, and composed merely of dark green
confervæ, or purple or yellow lichens; but they are
sometimes even of some feet in diameter, and contain
seeds and various species of common water-plants,
which are usually more or less incrusted with
marble. There is, I believe, no place in the world
where there is a more striking example of the opposition
or contrast of the laws of animate and inanimate
nature, of the forces of inorganic chemical
affinity and those of the powers of life. Vegetables,
in such a temperature, and every where surrounded
by food, are produced with a wonderful rapidity;
but the crystallizations are formed with equal quickness,
and they are no sooner produced than they are
destroyed together. The quantity of vegetable
matter and its heat make it the resort of an infinite
variety of insect tribes; and, even in the coldest
days in winter, numbers of flies may be observed on
the vegetables surrounding its banks or on its floating
islands, and a quantity of their larvæ may be
seen there, sometimes incrusted and entirely destroyed
by calcareous matter, which is likewise often the
fate of the insects themselves, as well as of various
species of shell-fish that are found amongst the vegetables
which grow and are destroyed in the travertine
on its banks.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>"I have passed many hours, I may say, many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
days, in studying the phenomena of this wonderful
lake; it has brought many trains of thought into
my mind connected with the early changes of our
globe, and I have sometimes reasoned from the
forms of plants and animals preserved in marble
in this warm source, to the grander depositions in
the secondary rocks, where the zoophytes or coral
insects have worked upon a grand scale, and where
palms and vegetables now unknown are preserved
with the remains of crocodiles, turtles, and gigantic
extinct animals of the <em>Sauri</em> genus, and which appear
to have belonged to a period when the whole
globe possessed a much higher temperature.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>"Then, from all we know, this lake, except in
some change in its dimensions, continues nearly in
the same state in which it was described seventeen
hundred years ago by Pliny, and I have no doubt
contains the same kinds of floating islands, the same
plants, and the same insects. During the fifteen
years that I have known it, it has appeared precisely
identical in these respects; and yet it has the
character of an accidental phenomenon depending
upon subterraneous fire. How marvellous then are
those laws by which even the humblest types of
organic existence are preserved, though born amidst
the sources of their destruction, and by which a
species of immortality is given to generations, floating,
as it were, like evanescent bubbles on a stream
raised from the deepest caverns of the earth, and
instantly losing what may be called its spirit in the
atmosphere!"</p>

<p>From this interesting discourse on the formation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
of Travertine, the conversation naturally turned to
Geology; and I shall here again be compelled to
give another copious extract, in order to show what
were the latest opinions of Sir H. Davy upon this
subject. If any doubt could exist as to the views
here given being those entertained by the author,
it is at once removed by his letter to Mr. Poole, in
which, alluding to the work under review, he says,
"<em>It contains the essence of my philosophical opinions.</em>"</p>

<p>"On the geological scheme of the early history
of the globe, there are only analogies to guide us,
which different minds may apply and interpret in
different ways; but I will not trifle with a long preliminary
discourse. Astronomical deductions and
actual measures by triangulation prove that the
globe is an oblate spheroid flattened at the poles;
and this form, we know, by strict mathematical demonstrations,
is precisely the one which a fluid body
revolving round its axis and become solid at its
surface by the slow dissipation of its heat or other
causes, would assume. I suppose, therefore, that
the globe, in the first state in which the imagination
can venture to consider it, was a fluid mass
with an immense atmosphere, revolving in space
round the sun, and that by its cooling, a portion of
its atmosphere was condensed in water which occupied
a part of the surface. In this state, no forms
of life, such as now belong to our system, could
have inhabited it; and I suppose the crystalline
rocks, or, as they are called by geologists, the <em>primary</em>
rocks, which contain no vestiges of a former
order of things, were the results of the first consolidation
on its surface. Upon the farther cooling,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
the water which more or less had covered it, contracted;
depositions took place, shell-fish, and coral
insects of the first creation began their labours, and
islands appeared in the midst of the ocean, raised
from the deep by the productive energies of millions
of zoophytes. These islands became covered
with vegetables fitted to bear a high temperature,
such as palms, and various species of plants similar
to those which now exist in the hottest part of the
world. And the submarine rocks or shores of these
new formations of land became covered with aquatic
vegetables, on which various species of shell-fish
and common fishes found their nourishment. The
fluids of the globe in cooling deposited a large
quantity of the materials they held in solution, and
these deposits agglutinating together the sand, the
immense masses of coral rocks, and some of the
remains of the shells and fishes found round the
shores of the primitive lands, produced the first
order of <em>secondary</em> rocks.</p>

<p>"As the temperature of the globe became lower,
species of the oviparous reptiles were created to
inhabit it; and the turtle, crocodile, and various
gigantic animals of the <em>Sauri</em> kind, seem to have
haunted the bays and waters of the primitive lands.
But in this state of things there was no order of
events similar to the present,&mdash;the crust of the
globe was exceedingly slender, and the source of
fire a small distance from the surface. In consequence
of contraction in one part of the mass, cavities
were opened, which caused the entrance of
water, and immense volcanic explosions took place,
raising one part of the surface, depressing another,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
producing mountains and causing new and extensive
depositions from the primitive ocean. Changes
of this kind must have been extremely frequent in
the early epochas of nature; and the only living
forms of which the remains are found in the strata
that are the monuments of these changes, are those
of plants, fishes, birds, and oviparous reptiles, which
seem most fitted to exist in such a war of the
elements.</p>

<p>"When these revolutions became less frequent,
and the globe became still more cooled, and the inequalities
of its temperature preserved by the mountain
chains, more perfect animals became its inhabitants,
many of which, such as the mammoth, megalonix,
megatherium, and gigantic hyena, are now
extinct. At this period, the temperature of the
ocean seems to have been not much higher than it
is at present, and the changes produced by occasional
eruptions of it have left no consolidated rocks.
Yet one of these eruptions appears to have been of
great extent and of some duration, and seems to
have been the cause of those immense quantities of
water-worn stones, gravel, and sand, which are usually
called <em>diluvian</em> remains;&mdash;and it is probable
that this effect was connected with the elevation of
a new continent in the southern hemisphere by volcanic
fire. When the system of things became so
permanent, that the tremendous revolutions depending
upon the destruction of the equilibrium between
the heating and cooling agencies were no
longer to be dreaded, the creation of man took
place; and since that period there has been little
alteration in the physical circumstances of our globe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
Volcanoes sometimes occasion the rise of new islands,
portions of the old continents are constantly
washed by rivers into the sea, but these changes are
too insignificant to affect the destinies of man, or
the nature of the physical circumstances of things.
On the hypothesis that I have adopted, however, it
must be remembered, that the present surface of the
globe is merely a thin crust surrounding a nucleus
of fluid ignited matter; and consequently, we can
hardly be considered as actually safe from the danger
of a catastrophe by fire.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>"I beg you to consider the views I have been developing
as merely hypothetical, one of the many
resting-places that may be taken by the imagination
in considering this subject. There are, however,
distinct facts in favour of the idea, that the interior
of the globe has a higher temperature than the surface;
the heat increasing in mines the deeper we penetrate,
and the number of warm sources which rise
from great depths, in almost all countries, are certainly
favourable to the idea. The opinion, that
volcanoes are owing to this general and simple cause,
is, I think, likewise more agreeable to the analogies
of things, than to suppose them dependent upon
partial chemical changes, such as the action of air
and water upon the combustible bases of the earths
and alkalies, though it is extremely probable that
these substances may exist beneath the surface, and
may occasion some results of volcanic fire;&mdash;and on
this subject my notion may perhaps be the more
trusted, as for a long while I thought volcanic eruptions
were owing to chemical agencies of the newly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
discovered metals of the earths and alkalies, and I
made many and some dangerous experiments in the
hope of confirming this notion, but in vain.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>"I have no objection to the '<em>refined Plutonic
view</em>,' (of Professor Playfair and Sir James Hall,) as
capable of explaining many existing phenomena;
indeed, you must be aware that I have myself had
recourse to it. What I contend against is, its application
to explain the formations of the secondary
rocks, which I think clearly belong to an order of
facts not at all embraced by it. In the Plutonic
system, there is one simple and constant order assumed,
which may be supposed eternal. The surface
is constantly imagined to be disintegrated,
destroyed, degraded, and washed into the bosom of
the ocean by water, and as constantly consolidated,
elevated, and regenerated by fire; and the ruins of
the old form the foundations of the new world. It
is supposed that there are always the same types
both of dead and living matter,&mdash;that the remains of
rocks, of vegetables, and animals of one age are
found imbedded in rocks raised from the bottom of
the ocean in another. Now, to support this view,
not only the remains of living beings which at present
people the globe, might be expected to be found
in the oldest secondary strata, but even those of the
art of man, the most powerful and populous of its
inhabitants, which is well known not to be the case.
On the contrary, each stratum of the secondary
rocks contains remains of peculiar and mostly now
unknown species of vegetables and animals. In
those strata which are deepest, and which must consequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
be supposed to be the earliest deposited,
forms even of vegetable life are rare; shells and vegetable
remains are found in the next order; the
bones of fishes and oviparous reptiles exist in the
following class; the remains of birds, with those of
the same genera mentioned before, in the next
order; those of quadrupeds of extinct species in a
still more recent class; and it is only in the loose
and slightly consolidated strata of gravel and sand,
and which are usually called diluvian formations,
that the remains of animals, such as now people the
globe, are found, with others belonging to extinct
species. But in none of these formations, whether
called secondary, tertial, or diluvial, have the remains
of man, or any of his works, been discovered.
It is, I think, impossible to consider the organic
remains found in any of the earlier secondary strata,
the lias-limestone and its congenerous formations,
for instance, without being convinced, that the
beings whose organs they formed belonged to an
order of things entirely different from the present.
Gigantic vegetables, more nearly allied to the palms
of the equatorial countries than to any other plants,
can only be imagined to have lived in a very high
temperature; and the immense reptiles, the <em>Megalosauri</em>,
with paddles instead of legs, and clothed in
mail, in size equal, or even superior to the whale;
and the great amphibia <em>Plethiosauri</em>, with bodies
like turtles, but furnished with necks longer than
their bodies, probably to enable them to feed on vegetables
growing in the shallows of the primitive
ocean, seem to show a state in which low lands, or
extensive shores, rose above an immense calm sea,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
and when there were no great mountain chains to
produce inequalities of temperature, tempests, or
storms. Were the surface of the earth now to be
carried down into the depths of the ocean, or were
some great revolution of the waters to cover the
existing land, and it was again to be elevated by
fire, covered with consolidated depositions of sand
or mud, how entirely different would it be in its
characters from any of the secondary strata! Its
great features would undoubtedly be the works of
man: hewn stones, and statues of bronze and marble,
and tools of iron, and human remains, would be
more common than those of animals, on the greatest
part of the surface; the columns of Pæstum, or of
Agrigentum, or the immense iron bridges of the
Thames, would offer a striking contrast to the bones
of the crocodiles, or <em>Sauri</em>, in the older rocks, or even
to those of the mammoth, or <em>Elephas primogenius</em>,
in the diluvial strata. And whoever dwells upon
this subject must be convinced, that the present
order of things, and the comparatively recent existence
of man, as the master of the globe, is as certain
as the destruction of a former and a different
order, and the extinction of a number of living
forms, which have now no types in being, and which
have left their remains wonderful monuments of
the revolutions of nature."</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fourth Dialogue</span>, to which is given the
title of "The Proteus, or Immortality," is of a more
desultory nature than those which precede it. It
contains many beautiful descriptions of scenery in
the Alpine country of Austria; furnishes an interesting
account of that most singular reptile the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
<em>Proteus Anguinus</em>, which is found only in the limestone
caverns of Carniola, and concludes with reflections
upon the indestructibility of the sentient
principle.</p>

<p>The author's companion, during the tour he describes,
is a scientific friend, whom he calls <em>Eubathes</em>.
The dialogue opens with a passage of considerable
pathos and eloquence: the author having been recalled
to England by a melancholy event, the death
of a very near and dear relation, describes his feelings
on entering London.</p>

<p>"In my youth, and through the prime of manhood,
I never entered London without feelings of
pleasure and hope. It was to me as the grand theatre
of intellectual activity, the field of every species
of enterprise and exertion, the metropolis of the
world of business, thought, and action. There, I
was sure to find the friends and companions of my
youth, to hear the voice of encouragement and
praise. There, society of the most refined kind
offered daily its banquets to the mind, with such
variety that satiety had no place in them, and new
objects of interest and ambition were constantly
exciting attention either in politics, literature, or
science.</p>

<p>"I now entered this great city in a very different
tone of mind&mdash;one of settled melancholy, not merely
produced by the mournful event which recalled me
to my country, but owing likewise to an entire
change in the condition of my physical, moral, and
intellectual being. My health was gone, my ambition
was satisfied; I was no longer excited by the
desire of distinction; what I regarded most tenderly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
was in the grave; and to take a metaphor, derived
from the change produced by time in the juice of
the grape, my cup of life was no longer sparkling,
sweet, and effervescent; it had lost its sweetness
without losing its power, and it had become bitter."</p>

<p>There is perhaps not a more splendid passage to
be found in the work; and it is scarcely inferior to
Dr. Johnson's memorable conclusion to the preface
of his Dictionary.</p>

<p>"After passing a few months in England," says
he, "and enjoying (as much as I could enjoy any
thing) the society of the few friends who still remained
alive, the desire of travel again seized me.
I had preserved amidst the wreck of time, one
feeling strong and unbroken&mdash;the love of natural
scenery; and this, in advanced life, formed a principal
motive for my plans of conduct and action."</p>

<p>The fall of the Traun, about ten miles below
Gmünden, was one of his favourite haunts; and he
describes an accident of the most awful description
which befell him at this place. While amusing
himself on the water by a rapid species of locomotion,
in a boat so secured by a rope as to allow only
of a limited range, the tackle gave way, and he was
rapidly precipitated down the cataract. He remained
for some time after his rescue in a state of insensibility,
and on recovering found himself attended
by his mysterious friend the "Unknown," who had
so charmed him in his excursion to Pæstum.</p>

<p>With this stranger, he proceeded on his tour;
and he again becomes the medium through which
much philosophical information is conveyed to the
reader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
They visit together the grotto of the Maddalena
at Adelsberg, and he gives us the conversation that
took place in that extraordinary cavern.</p>

<p>"<em>Philalethes.</em>&mdash;If the awful chasms of dark masses
of rock surrounding us appear like the work of
demons, who might be imagined to have risen from
the centre of the earth, the beautiful works of nature
above our heads may be compared to a scenic representation
of a temple or banquet-hall for fairies or
genii, such as those fabled in the Arabian romances.</p>

<p>"<em>The Unknown.</em>&mdash;A poet might certainly place
here the palace of the king of the Gnomes, and
might find marks of his creative power in the small
lake close by, on which the flame of the torch is
now falling; for, there it is that I expect to find
the extraordinary animals which have been so long
the objects of my attention.</p>

<p>"<em>Eubathes.</em>&mdash;I see three or four creatures, like
slender fish, moving on the mud below the water.</p>

<p>"<em>The Unknown.</em>&mdash;I see them; they are the Protei,&mdash;now
I have them in my fishing-net, and now
they are safe in the pitcher of water. At first view,
you might suppose this animal to be a lizard, but it
has the motions of a fish. Its head, and the lower
part of its body and its tail, bear a strong resemblance
to those of the eel; but it has no fins; and
its curious bronchial organs are not like the gills of
fishes; they form a singular vascular structure, as
you see, almost like a crest, round the throat, which
may be removed without occasioning the death of
the animal, who is likewise furnished with lungs.
With this double apparatus for supplying air to the
blood, it can live either below or above the surface
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
of the water. Its fore-feet resemble hands, but
they have only three claws or fingers, are too feeble
to be of use in grasping, or supporting the weight
of the animal; the hinder feet have only two claws
or toes, and in larger specimens are found so imperfect
as to be almost obliterated. It has small points
in place of eyes, as if to preserve the analogy of
nature. Its nasal organs appear large; and it is
abundantly furnished with teeth, from which it
may be concluded that it is an animal of prey; yet
in its confined state it has never been known to
eat, and it has been kept alive for many years
by occasionally changing the water in which it is
placed.</p>

<p>"<em>Eubathes.</em>&mdash;Is this the only place in Carniola
where these animals are found?</p>

<p>"<em>The Unknown.</em>&mdash;They were first discovered here
by the late Baron Zois; but they have since been
found, though rarely, at Sittich, about thirty miles
distant, thrown up by water from a subterraneous
cavity; and I have lately heard it reported that
some individuals of the same species have been recognised
in the calcareous strata in Sicily. I think
it cannot be doubted, that their natural residence is
an extensive deep subterranean lake, from which in
great floods they sometimes are forced through the
crevices of the rocks into this place where they are
found; and it does not appear to me impossible,
when the peculiar nature of the country in which
we are is considered, that the same great cavity may
furnish the individuals which have been found at
Adelsberg and at Sittich.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
"This adds one more instance to the number
already known of the wonderful manner in which
life is produced and perpetuated in every part of
our globe, even in places which seem the least suited
to organized existence. And the same infinite
power and wisdom which has fitted the camel and
the ostrich for the deserts of Africa, the swallow
that secretes its own nest for the caves of Java, the
whale for the Polar seas, and the morse and white
bear for the Arctic ice, has given the Proteus to the
deep and dark subterraneous lakes of Illyria,&mdash;an
animal to whom the presence of light is not essential,
and who can live indifferently in air and in
water, on the surface of the rock, or in the depths
of the mud."</p>

<p>Much interesting physiological discussion follows.
I shall, however, merely notice the opinion delivered
by the "Unknown," on the subject of respiration,
and which I think shows that, at the conclusion
of his career, Davy entertained the same notions,
with regard to the communication of some
ethereal principle to the blood, as he maintained in
the earlier part of his life.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>&mdash;"The obvious chemical
alteration of the air is sufficiently simple in this
process; a certain quantity of carbon only is added
to it, and it receives an addition of heat or vapour;
the volumes of elastic fluid inspired and expired
(making allowance for change of temperature,) are
the same, and if ponderable agents only were to be
regarded, it would appear as if the only use of respiration
were to free the blood from a certain quantity
of carbonaceous matter. But it is probable that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
this is only a secondary object, and that the change
produced by respiration upon the blood is of a much
more important kind. Oxygen, in its elastic state,
has properties which are very characteristic; it gives
out light by compression, which is not certainly
known to be the case with any other elastic fluid
except those which oxygen has entered without undergoing
combustion; and from the fire it produces
in certain processes, and from the manner in which
it is separated by positive electricity in the gaseous
state from its combinations, it is not easy to avoid
the supposition, that it contains, besides its ponderable
elements, some very subtile matter which is
capable of assuming the form of heat and light.
<em>My idea</em> is, that the common air inspired enters into
the venous blood entire, in a state of dissolution,
carrying with it its subtile or ethereal part, which
in ordinary cases of chemical change is given off;
that it expels from the blood carbonic acid gas and
azote; and that, in the course of the circulation,
its ethereal part and its ponderable part undergo
changes which belong to laws that cannot be considered
as chemical,&mdash;the ethereal part probably producing
animal heat and other effects, and the ponderable
part contributing to form carbonic acid and
other products. The arterial blood is necessary to
all the functions of life, and it is no less connected
with the irritability of the muscles and the sensibility
of the nerves than with the performance of all
the secretions."</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fifth Dialogue</span> is entitled "The Chemist."
Its object is to demonstrate the importance
of this noble science. An interlocutor is made to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
disparage its utility, and to mark its weaker points.
These of course are answered, the sceptic becomes a
true believer, and the intellectual gladiators separate
mutually satisfied with each other.</p>

<p>"<em>Eubathes.</em>&mdash;I feel disposed to join you in attacking
this favourite study of our friend, <em>but merely</em> to
provoke him to defend it, in order to call forth his
skill and awaken his eloquence.</p>

<p>"<em>The Unknown.</em>&mdash;I have no objection. Let there
be a fair discussion: remember, we fight only with
foils, and the point of mine shall be covered with
velvet."</p>

<p>After having enumerated the scientific attainments
necessary to constitute the chemist, and described
the apparatus essential for understanding
what has been already done in the science, he proceeds
to define the intellectual qualities which he
considers necessary for discovery, or for the advancement
of the science. Amongst them, patience, industry,
and neatness in manipulation, and accuracy
and minuteness in observing and registering the
phenomena which occur, are essential. A steady
hand and a quick eye are most useful auxiliaries;
but there have been very few great chemists who
have preserved these advantages through life; for
the business of the laboratory is often a service of
danger, and the elements, like the refractory spirits
of romance, though the obedient slaves of the magician,
yet sometimes escape the influence of his talisman,
and endanger his person. Both the hands and
eyes of others, however, may be sometimes advantageously
made use of. By often repeating a process
or an observation, the errors connected with hasty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
operations or imperfect views are annihilated; and,
provided the assistant has no preconceived notions
of his own, and is ignorant of the object of his
employer in making the experiment, his simple and
bare detail of facts will often be the best foundation
for an opinion. With respect to the higher qualities
of intellect necessary for understanding and developing
the general laws of the science, the same talents,
I believe, are required as for making advancement
in every other department of human knowledge; I
need not be very minute. The imagination must
be active and brilliant in seeking analogies; yet entirely
under the influence of the judgment in applying
them. The memory must be extensive and
profound; rather, however, calling up general views
of things than minute trains of thought;&mdash;the mind
must not be like an Encyclopedia,&mdash;a burthen of
knowledge, but rather a critical Dictionary, which
abounds in generalities, and points out where more
minute information may be obtained.</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>"In announcing even the greatest and most important
discoveries, the true philosopher will communicate
his details with modesty and reserve; he
will rather be a useful servant of the public, bringing
forth a light from under his cloak when it is
needed in darkness, than a charlatan exhibiting fire-works,
and having a trumpeter to announce their
magnificence.</p>

<p>"I see you are smiling, and think what I am
saying in bad taste; yet, notwithstanding, I will
provoke your smiles still farther, by saying a word
or two on his other moral qualities. That he should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
be humble-minded, you will readily allow, and a
diligent searcher after truth, and neither diverted
from this great object by the love of transient glory
or temporary popularity, looking rather to the opinion
of ages than to that of a day, and seeking to
be remembered and named rather in the epochas of
historians than in the columns of newspaper writers
or journalists. He should resemble the modern
geometricians in the greatness of his views and the
profoundness of his researches, and the ancient alchemists
in industry and piety. I do not mean that
he should affix written prayers and inscriptions<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> of
recommendations of his processes to Providence, as
was the custom of Peter Wolfe, who was alive in
my early days; but his mind should always be
awake to devotional feelings; and in contemplating
the variety and the beauty of the external world, and
developing its scientific wonders, he will always
refer to that Infinite Wisdom, through whose beneficence
he is permitted to enjoy knowledge; and, in
becoming wiser, he will become better,&mdash;he will rise
at once in the scale of intellectual and moral existence,
his increased sagacity will be subservient to a
more exalted faith, and in proportion as the veil
becomes thinner through which he sees the causes of
things, he will admire more the brightness of the
divine light by which they are rendered visible."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
The <span class="smcap">Sixth and last Dialogue</span>, entitled
"<span class="smcap">Pola</span>, or <span class="smcap">Time</span>," presents a series of reflections, to
which a view of the decaying amphitheatre at Pola,
an ancient town in the peninsula of Istria, is represented
as having given origin. On former occasions,
the inspection of the mouldering works of
past ages called up trains of thought rather of a
moral than of a physical character; in the present
dialogue, the effects of time are considered in their
relations to the mechanical and chemical laws by
which material forms are destroyed, or rather
changed,&mdash;for the author has shown by a number
of beautiful examples, that without decay there can
be no reproduction, and that the principle of change
is a principle of life.</p>

<p>Having considered the influence of gravitation,
the chemical and mechanical agencies of water, air,
and electricity, and the energies of organized beings,
in producing those diversified phenomena which, in
our metaphysical abstractions, we universally refer
to Time, he proceeds to enquire how far art can
counteract their operation. A great philosopher,
he observes, has said, "Man can in no other way
command Nature but in obeying her laws:" it is
evident that, by the application of some of those
principles which she herself employs, we may for
a while arrest the progress of changes which are
ultimately inevitable.</p>

<p>"Yet, when all is done that can be done in the
work of conservation, it is only producing a difference
in the degree of duration. It is evident that
none of the works of a mortal can be eternal, as
none of the combinations of a limited intellect can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
be infinite. The operations of Nature, when slow,
are no less sure; however man may, for a time,
usurp dominion over her, she is certain of recovering
her empire. He converts her rocks, her stones, her
trees, into forms of palaces, houses, and ships; he
employs the metals found in the bosom of the
earth, as instruments of power, and the sands and
clays which constitute its surface, as ornaments and
resources of luxury; he imprisons air by water, and
tortures water by fire to change, or modify, or destroy
the natural forms of things. But in some
lustrums his works begin to change, and in a few
centuries they decay and are in ruins; and his
mighty temples, framed as it were for immortal and
divine purposes, and his bridges formed of granite
and ribbed with iron, and his walls for defence, and
the splendid monuments by which he has endeavoured
to give eternity even to his perishable remains,
are gradually destroyed; and these structures,
which have resisted the waves of the ocean,
the tempests of the sky, and the stroke of the lightning,
shall yield to the operation of the dews of
heaven,&mdash;of frost, rain, vapour, and imperceptible
atmospheric influences; and as the worm devours
the lineaments of his mortal beauty, so the lichens
and the moss and the most insignificant plants shall
feed upon his columns and his pyramids, and the
most humble and insignificant insect shall undermine
and sap the foundations of his colossal works,
and make their habitations amongst the ruins of
his palaces and the falling seats of his earthly glory."</p>

<p>On no occasion can such a subject be presented to
a contemplative mind, without filling it with awe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
and wonder; but the circumstances under which
these reflections are presented to us, in the last days
of our philosopher, impress upon them an almost
oracular solemnity. When we remember that while
the mind of the philosopher was thus engaged in
identifying the processes of decay with those of
renovation in the system of nature, his body was
palsied, and the current of his life fast ebbing, we
cannot but admire that active intelligence which
sparkled with such undiminished lustre amidst the
wreck of its earthly tenement.</p>

<p>In the extracts which have been introduced from
this last work, I trust the pledge that was given in
the earlier part of these memoirs, has been redeemed
by showing that a powerful imagination is not
necessarily incompatible with a sound judgment,
that the flowers of fancy are not always blighted
by the cold realities of science, but that the poet
and philosopher may, under the auspices of a happy
genius, mutually assist each other in expounding
the mysteries of nature. It cannot be denied, as a
general aphorism, that the tree which expands its
force in flowers is generally deficient in fruit; but
the mind of Davy, to borrow one of his own metaphors,
may be likened to those fabled of the Hesperides,
which produced at once buds, leaves, blossoms,
and fruits.</p>

<p>The happy effects resulting from this rare and
nicely adjusted combination of talents, offer themselves
as interesting subjects of biographical contemplation,
and they can be studied only with success
by a comparative analysis of different minds.</p>

<p>That the superiority of Davy greatly depended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
upon the vivacity and compass of his imagination
cannot be doubted, and such an opinion was well
expressed by Mr. Davies Gilbert, in his late address
to the Society:&mdash;"The poetic bent of Davy's mind
seems never to have left him. To that circumstance
I would ascribe the distinguishing features in his
character and in his discoveries:&mdash;a vivid imagination
sketching out new tracks in regions unexplored,
for the judgment to select those leading to
the recesses of abstract truth."</p>

<p>I have always thought that the mind of the late
Dr. Clarke, the Mineralogical Professor of Cambridge,
was little less imaginative than that of Davy;
but it was deficient in judgment, and therefore often
conducted him to error instead of to truth. Dr.
Black was not deficient in imagination, and certainly
not in judgment; but there was a constitutional
apathy, arising probably from ill health, which
damped his noblest efforts.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
It is by the rarity with which the talent of seizing
upon remote analogies is associated with a spirit of
patient and subtile investigation of details, and a
quick perception of their value, that the fact so truly
stated by Mr. Babbage is to be explained; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i>m> that
long intervals frequently elapse between the discovery
of new principles in science and their practical
application: thus he observes, that "the principle of
the hydrostatic paradox was known as a speculative
truth in the time of Stevinus, as far back as the
year 1600,&mdash;and its application to raising heavy
weights has long been stated in elementary treatises
on natural philosophy, as well as constantly exhibited
in lectures; yet it may fairly be regarded as a
mere abstract principle, until the late Mr. Bramah,
by substituting a pump, instead of the smaller column,
converted it into a most valuable and powerful
engine. The principle of the convertibility of the
centres of oscillation and suspension in the pendulum,
discovered by Huygens more than a century
and a half ago, remained, until within these few
years, a sterile though most elegant proposition;
when, after being hinted at by Prony, and distinctly
pointed out by Bonenberger, it was employed by
Captain Kater as the foundation of a most convenient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
method of determining the length of the pendulum.
The interval which separated the discovery
of Dr. Black, of latent heat, from the beautiful
and successful application of it to the steam-engine,
was comparatively short; but it required the efforts
of two minds; and both were of the highest order."<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>The discoveries of Davy present themselves in
striking contrast with such instances. The same
powerful genius that developed the laws of electro-chemical
decomposition, was the first to apply them
for the purpose of obviating metallic corrosion; and
the nature of <em>fire-damp</em>, and the fact of its combustion
being arrested in its passage through capillary
tubes, were alike the discoveries of him who first
applied them for the construction of a safety-lamp.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>In contrasting the genius of Wollaston with that
of Davy, let me not be supposed to invite a comparison
to the disparagement of either, but rather to
the glory of both, for by mutual reflection each will
glow the brighter. If the animating principle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
Davy's mind was a powerful imagination, generalizing
phenomena, and casting them into new combinations,
so may the striking characteristic of Wollaston's
genius be said to have been an almost superhuman
perception of minute detail. Davy was ever
imagining something greater than he knew; Wollaston
always knew something more than he acknowledged:&mdash;in
Wollaston, the predominant principle
was to avoid error; in Davy, it was the desire to
discover truth. The tendency of Davy, on all occasions,
was to raise probabilities into facts; while
Wollaston as continually made them subservient to
the expression of doubt.</p>

<p>Wollaston was deficient in imagination, and under
no circumstances could he have become a Poet;
nor was it to be expected that his investigations
should have led him to any of those comprehensive
generalizations which create new systems of philosophy.
He well knew the compass of his powers, and
he pursued the only method by which they could
be rendered available in advancing knowledge. He
was a giant in strength, but it was the strength of
Antæus, mighty only on the earth. The extreme
caution and reserve of his manner were inseparably
connected with the habits of his mind; they pervaded
every part of his character; in his amusements
and in his scientific experiments, he displayed
the same nice and punctilious observation,&mdash;whether
he was angling for trout,<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> or testing for elements,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
he alike relied for success upon his subtile
discrimination of minute circumstances.</p>

<p>By comparing the writings as well as the discoveries
of these two great philosophers, we shall readily
perceive the intellectual distinctions I have endeavoured
to establish. "From their fruits shall ye
know them." The discoveries of Davy were the
results of extensive views and new analogies; those
of Wollaston were derived from a more exact examination
of minute and, to ordinary observers,
scarcely appreciable differences. This is happily
illustrated by a comparison of the means by which
each discovered new metals. The alkaline bases
were the products of a comprehensive investigation,
which had developed a new order of principles; the
detection of palladium and rhodium among the ores
of platinum, was the reward of delicate manipulation,
and microscopic scrutiny. As chemical operators,
I have already pointed out their striking peculiarities,
and they will be found to be in strict keeping
with the other features of their respective characters.
I might extend the parallel farther; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
Dr. Henry, in the eleventh edition of his "System
of Chemistry," has delineated the intellectual portraits
of these two philosophers with so masterly a
hand, that by quoting the passage, all farther observation
will be rendered unnecessary.</p>

<p>"To those high gifts of nature, which are the
characteristics of genius, and which constitute its
very essence, both those eminent men united an
unwearied industry and zeal in research, and habits
of accurate reasoning, without which even the energies
of genius are inadequate to the achievement of
great scientific designs. With these excellencies,
common to both, they were nevertheless distinguishable
by marked intellectual peculiarities. Bold,
ardent, and enthusiastic, Davy soared to greater
heights; he commanded a wider horizon; and his
keen vision penetrated to its utmost boundaries.
His imagination, in the highest degree fertile and
inventive, took a rapid and extensive range in pursuit
of conjectural analogies, which he submitted to
close and patient comparison with known facts, and
tried by an appeal to ingenious and conclusive experiments.
He was imbued with the spirit, and was
a master in the practice, of the inductive logic; and
he has left us some of the noblest examples of the
efficacy of that great instrument of human reason
in the discovery of truth. He applied it, not only
to connect classes of facts of more limited extent
and importance, but to develope great and comprehensive
laws, which embrace phenomena that are
almost universal to the natural world. In explaining
those laws, he cast upon them the illumination
of his own clear and vivid conceptions;&mdash;he felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
an intense admiration of the beauty, order, and
harmony, which are conspicuous in the perfect Chemistry
of Nature;&mdash;and he expressed those feelings
with a force of eloquence which could issue
only from a mind of the highest powers and of
the finest sensibilities. With much less enthusiasm
from temperament, Dr. Wollaston was endowed
with bodily senses<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> of extraordinary acuteness
and accuracy, and with great general vigour
of understanding. Trained in the discipline of the
exact sciences, he had acquired a powerful command
over his attention, and had habituated himself
to the most rigid correctness, both of thought
and of language. He was sufficiently provided with
the resources of the mathematics, to be enabled to
pursue with success profound enquiries in mechanical
and optical philosophy, the results of which
enabled him to unfold the causes of phenomena not
before understood, and to enrich the arts connected
with those sciences, by the invention of ingenious
and valuable instruments. In Chemistry, he was
distinguished by the extreme nicety and delicacy
of his observations; by the quickness and precision
with which he marked resemblances and discriminated
differences; the sagacity with which he devised
experiments and anticipated their results; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
the skill with which he executed the analysis of fragments
of new substances, often so minute as to be
scarcely perceptible by ordinary eyes. He was remarkable,
too, for the caution with which he advanced
from facts to general conclusions: a caution
which, if it sometimes prevented him from reaching
at once to the most sublime truths, yet rendered
every step of his ascent a secure station, from which
it was easy to rise to higher and more enlarged inductions.
Thus these illustrious men, though differing
essentially in their natural powers and acquired
habits, and moving, independently of each other,
in different paths, contributed to accomplish the same
great ends&mdash;the evolving new elements; the combining
matter into new forms; the increase of human
happiness by the improvement of the arts of
civilized life; and the establishment of general laws,
that will serve to guide other philosophers onwards,
through vast and unexplored regions of scientific
discovery."</p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>My history draws towards a conclusion.&mdash;Sir
Humphry Davy, during the latter days of his life,
was cheered by the society and affectionate attentions
of his godson, the son of his old friend Mr.
James Tobin.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> He had been the companion of his
travels, and he was the solace of his declining hours.</p>

<p>He had been resident for some months at Rome,
where he occupied the second floor of a house in
Via di Pietra, a street that leads out of the Corso.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
During this period, he declined receiving any visitors,
and had constantly some one by his side reading
light works of interest to him, an amusement
which was even continued during his meals.</p>

<p>As soon as the account of Sir Humphry having
sustained another paralytic seizure was communicated
to Lady Davy, who was in London at the
time, she immediately set off, and so rapidly was
her journey performed, that she reached Rome in
little more than twelve days. Dr. John Davy, also,
hastened from Malta, on receiving intelligence of
his brother's imminent danger.</p>

<p>During his slow and partial recovery from this
seizure, he learnt the circumstance of his name
having been introduced into parliamentary proceedings,
in the following manner. On the 26th of
March 1829, on presenting a petition in favour of
the Catholic claims from a very great and most respectable
meeting at Edinburgh, Sir James Mackintosh,
after having mentioned the name of Sir Walter
Scott as being at the head of the petitioners, continued
thus:&mdash;"Although not pertinent to this petition,
yet connected with the cause, I indulge in the
melancholy pleasure of adding to the first name in
British literature the first name in British science&mdash;that
of Sir Humphry Davy. Though on a sick-bed
at Rome, he was not so absorbed by his sufferings
as not to feel and express the glow of joy that shot
across his heart at the glad tidings of the introduction
of a bill which he hailed as alike honourable to
his religion and his country."</p>

<p>I am assured that the last mark of satisfaction
which he evinced from any intelligence communicated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
to him was on reading the above passage.
He showed a pleasure unusual in his state of languor
at the justice thus done, in the face of his
country, to his consistency, to his zeal for religion
and liberty, and to the generous sentiments which
cheered his debility. The marks of his pleasure
were observed by those who were brought most
near to him by the performance of every kind office.</p>

<p>Although there appeared some faint indications
of reviving power, his most sanguine friends scarcely
ventured to indulge a hope that his life would be
much longer protracted. Nor did he himself expect
it. The expressions in his Will (printed in an
Appendix) sufficiently testify the opinion he had
for some time entertained of the hopelessness of
his case.</p>

<p>In addition to this Will, he left a paper of directions,
which have been religiously observed by his
widow. He desires, for instance, that the interest
arising from a hundred pounds stock may be annually
paid to the Master of the Penzance Grammar
School, on condition that the boys may have a holiday
on his birthday.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> There is something singularly
interesting in this favourable recollection of
his native town, and of the associations of his early
youth. It adds one more example to show that,
whatever may have been our destinies, and however
fortune may have changed our conditions, where
the heart remains uncorrupted, we shall, as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
world closes upon us, fix our imaginations upon the
simplicities of our youth, and be cheered and warmed
by the remembrance of early pleasures, hallowed
by feelings of regard for the memory of those who
have long since slept in the grave.</p>

<p>With that restlessness which characterises the
disease under which Sir Humphry Davy suffered,
he became extremely desirous of quitting Rome, and
of establishing himself at Geneva. His friends were
naturally anxious to gratify every wish; and Lady
Davy kindly preceded him on the journey, in order
that she might at each stage make arrangements for
his comfortable reception. Apartments were prepared
for him at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Hotel de la Couronne</i>, in the Rue
du Rhone; and at three o'clock on the 28th of May,
having slept the preceding evening at Chambery,
he arrived at Geneva, accompanied by his brother,
Mr. Tobin, and his servant.</p>

<p>At four o'clock he dined, ate heartily, was unusually
cheerful, and joked with the waiter about
the cookery of the fish, which he appeared particularly
to admire; and he desired that, as long as he
remained at the hotel, he might be daily supplied
with every possible variety that the lake afforded.
He drank tea at eleven, and having directed that
the feather-bed should be removed, retired to rest at
twelve.</p>

<p>His servant, who slept in a bed parallel to his
own, in the same alcove, was however very shortly
called to attend him, and he desired that his brother
might be summoned. I am informed that, on Dr.
Davy's entering the room, he said, "I am dying,"
or words to that effect; "and when it is all over, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
desire that no disturbance of any kind may be made
in the house; lock the door, and let every one retire
quietly to his apartment." He expired at a quarter
before three o'clock, without a struggle.</p>

<p>On the following morning, his friends Sismondi<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
and De Candolle were sent for; and the
Syndics, as soon as the circumstance of his death
was communicated to them, gave directions for a
public funeral on the Monday; at which the magistrates,
the professors, the English residents at
Geneva, and such inhabitants as desired it, were invited
to attend. The ceremony was ordered to be
conducted after the custom of Geneva, which is
always on foot&mdash;no hearse; nor did a single carriage
attend. The cemetery is at Plain-Palais, some little
distance out of the walls of the town. The Couronne
being at the opposite extremity, the procession
was long.</p>

<p>The following was the order of the procession:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p>

<hr class="c15" />

<p>Sir Humphry Davy having died without issue,
his baronetcy has become extinct.</p>

<p>At present, the only memorial raised to commemorate
the name of this distinguished philosopher
is a Tablet placed in Westminster Abbey by
his widow. It is thus inscribed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bbox">
<p class="center">TO THE MEMORY OF<br />
SIR HUMPHRY DAVY, BARONET;<br />
DISTINGUISHED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD<br />
BY HIS<br />
DISCOVERIES IN CHEMICAL SCIENCE.<br />
PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY;<br />
MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FRANCE.<br />
BORN 17 DECEMBER 1778, AT PENZANCE.<br />
DIED 28 MAY 1829, AT GENEVA,<br />
WHERE HIS REMAINS ARE INTERRED.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
The numerous scientific societies of which he was
a member, will, no doubt, consecrate his memory.
An eloquent Eloge has been read by Baron Cuvier
before the Institute of France; but it has not yet
been published: I have obtained, however, a copy
of a speech delivered upon the same occasion, by
H. C. Van der Boon Mesch, before the Institute of
the Netherlands.</p>

<p>Mr. Davies Gilbert, his early friend and patron,
has likewise paid to his memory a just and appropriate
testimony of respect and admiration, in an
address from the chair of the Royal Society.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Penzance and its neighbourhood,
animated by feelings of honourable pride and
strong local attachment, will shortly, it is understood,
raise a pyramid of massive granite to his
memory, on one of those elevated spots of silence
and solitude, where he delighted in his boyish days
to commune with the elements, and where the
Spirit of Nature moulded his genius in one of her
wildest moods.</p>

<p>As yet, no intention on the part of the Government
to commemorate this great philosopher, by
the erection of a national monument, has been manifested:
for the credit, however, of an age which is
so continually distinguished as the most enlightened
period in our history, I do hope the disgrace of such
an omission may pass from us; although, I confess,
it is rather to be wished than expected, when it is
remembered that not a niche has been graced by
the statue of Watt, while the giant iron children of
his inventive genius are serving mankind in every
quarter of the civilized world. A very erroneous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
impression would seem to exist with regard to the
object and importance of such monuments. They
are not to honour the dead, but to improve the
living; not to give lustre to the philosopher, but to
afford a salutary incentive to the disciple; not to
perpetuate discoveries, for they can never be lost;
but to animate scientific genius, and to engage it
upon objects that may be useful to the commonwealth.
Let it be remembered, that the ardour of the
Roman youth was kindled into active emulation,
whenever they beheld the images of their ancestors.</p>

<p>"Nam sæpe audivi, Q. Maximum, P. Scipionem,
præterea civitatis nostræ præclaros viros, solitos ita
dicere, cùm majorum imagines intuerentur, vehementissimè
sibi animum ad virtutem accendi. Scilicet
non ceram illam, neque figuram tantam vim in
sese habere; sed memoriâ rerum gestarum eam flammam

adæquaverit."<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>The fame of such a philosopher as Davy can
never be exalted by any frail memorial which man
can raise. His monument is in the great Temple
of Nature.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> His chroniclers are Time and the
Elements. The destructive agents which reduce to
dust the storied urn, the marble statue, and the
towering pyramid, were the ministers of his power,
and their work of decomposition is a perpetual memorial
of his intelligence.</p>

<h2>A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF CHEMICAL SCIENCE,
WITH A VIEW TO EXHIBIT THE REVOLUTIONS PRODUCED
IN ITS DOCTRINES BY THE DISCOVERIES OF
SIR HUMPHRY DAVY.</h2>

<p>The rapidity with which chemical opinions have
risen into notice, flourished for a while, and then
fallen into disrepute, to be succeeded by others
equally precarious in their tenure and ephemeral in
their popularity, are circumstances which the superficial
reasoner has ever deplored, and the Sciolist as
constantly converted into arguments against the
soundness of the science which produced them.
The leaves of a season will sprout, expand, and
wither; and the dry foliage will be pushed off by
the propulsion of new buds; but this last change is
not effected in them, until they have absorbed the
light and dews of heaven for the nourishment of the
plant that bore them; and when even they shall
have fallen to the earth, they will farther supply its
spreading roots with fresh soil for its future growth
and healthy developement; and entering into new
combinations, will re-appear in the same tree under
fresh forms of usefulness and symmetry. In like
manner, chemical theories are but for a season; they
are nothing more than general expressions of known
facts; they may delight by their ingenuity, as vegetable
forms captivate by their beauty, but their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
real and substantial use is to extend science; and as
facts accumulate under their operation, they must
give way to others better adapted to the increased
growth and expansion of knowledge; nor does the
utility of theories cease with their rejection,&mdash;they
afford objects of analogy and comparison which
assist the philosopher in his progress to truth, while
their elements furnish materials for future arrangements.
Were it otherwise, we should behold science
in its advancement as a shapeless mass, enlarging
by constant appositions, but without a single sign of
growth or inward sympathy.</p>

<p>If chemical theories have undergone more rapid
and frequent changes than those of other branches,
the circumstance has arisen from the rapid manner
in which new and important facts have been successively
added to the general store.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the vices attributed to Chemistry
on such occasions, they have belonged to the
philosophers engaged in its pursuit, and are no evidence
of the frailty of the science itself; and here it
must be admitted, that there exists in one portion of
mankind a self-love which cannot patiently submit
to a change of opinions of which they are either
the authors or defenders, while in another there
predominates a timidity which naturally leads them,
amidst the storm of controversy, to cling to the
wreck of a shattered theory, rather than to trust
themselves to a new and untried bark.</p>

<p>In our review of the history of Science, we have
frequently to witness how the wisest philosopher
has strained truth, for the support of a favourite
doctrine, and measured and accommodated facts to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
theory, instead of adapting theories to facts&mdash;but
this vice does not belong exclusively to chemical
philosophers. Huygens, the celebrated Dutch Astronomer,
from some imaginary property in the
number <em>six</em>, having discovered <em>one</em> of Saturn's
moons, absolutely declined looking for any more,
merely because that one, when added to the four
moons of Jupiter, and to the one belonging to the
Earth, made up the required number.</p>

<p>Such reflections naturally arise on viewing, with
a philosophic eye, the progress and modifications
of chemical opinions; and it is essential that they
should be duly appreciated upon the present occasion;
for, before any just estimate can be formed of
the talents and services of Sir Humphry Davy, we
must thoroughly consider, in all their bearings and
relations, the various prejudices with which he had
to contend in his efforts to modify a gigantic theory,
which enjoyed an unrestrained dominion in the chemical
world, and for many years continued to be the
pride of France and the admiration of Europe.</p>

<p>It would be quite foreign to the plan of this
sketch,<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> which the reader must consider as wholly
subservient to the object that has been announced,
to enquire how far the ancients, in their metallurgical
processes, can be said to have exercised the arts of
chemistry. Equally vain would it be to enter into a
history of that system of delusion and imposture, so
long practised under the denomination of Alchymy.
It is only necessary to consider Chemistry in its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
dignified and purely scientific form; and we have
only to notice those commanding discoveries and
opinions which led to the developement of that system,
which the genius of Davy was destined to
modify.</p>

<p>The origin of Chemistry, as a science, cannot be
dated farther back than about the middle of the
seventeenth century; and Beccher, the contemporary
of Boyle, who was born at Spires in 1635, was
unquestionably the first to construct any thing like
a general theory. He formed the bold idea of explaining
the whole system of the earth by the mutual
agency and changes of a few elements. And
by supposing the existence of a vitrifiable, a metallic,
and an inflammable earth, he attempted to account
for the various productions of rocks, crystalline
bodies, and metallic veins, assuming a continual
interchange of principles between the atmosphere,
the ocean, and the solid surface of the globe, and
considering the operations of nature as all capable of
being imitated by art.</p>

<p>Albertus Magnus had advanced the opinion that
the metals were earthy substances impregnated with
a certain inflammable principle; but Beccher supported
the idea of this principle not only as the cause
of metallization, but likewise of combustibility.
Stahl, however, one of the most extraordinary men
that Germany ever produced, having adopted and
amplified this theory, carried off the entire credit of
being its founder, and it is universally spoken of as
the <em>Stahlian Theory</em>.</p>

<p>This theory forms so important a feature in the
history of chemistry, and so long maintained its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
ascendency in the schools, that it will be necessary
to give the reader a short summary of its principles.
It assumed that all <em>combustible</em> bodies are compounds:
one of the constituents being volatile, and therefore
easily dissipated during the act of combustion; while
the other, being fixed, constantly remained as the
residue of the process. This volatile principle, for
which Stahl invented the term <em>Phlogiston</em>, was considered
as being identical in every species of combustible
matter; in short, it was supposed that there was
but one principle of combustibility in nature, and
that was the imaginary phantom Phlogiston, which
for nearly a century possessed the schools of Europe,
and, like an evil spirit, crossed the path of the philosopher
at every step, and by its treacherous glare
allured him from the steady pursuit of truth; for,
whether a substance were combustible or not, its
nature could never be investigated without a reference
to its supposed relations with Phlogiston; its
presence, or its absence, was supposed to stamp a
character upon all bodies, and to occasion all the
changes which they undergo. Hence chemistry and
combustion came to be in some measure identified;
and a theory of combustion was considered the same
thing as a theory of chemistry.</p>

<p>The identity of Phlogiston in all combustible
bodies was founded upon observations and experiments
of so decisive a nature, that after the existence
of the principle itself was admitted, they could not
fail to be satisfactory. When phosphorus is made to
burn, it gives out a strong flame, much heat is
evolved, and the phosphorus is dissipated in fumes,
which, if properly collected, will quickly absorb
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
moisture from the atmosphere, and produce an acid
liquid known by the name of phosphoric acid.
Phosphorus then must consist, say the Stahlians, of
Phlogiston and this acid. Again&mdash;If this liquid be
evaporated to a dry substance, mixed with a quantity
of charcoal powder, and then heated in a vessel
from which the external air is excluded, a <em>portion</em>, or
the <em>whole</em> of the charcoal will disappear, and phosphorus
will be reproduced, possessing all the properties
that it had before it was subjected to combustion.
In this case, it was supposed that the charcoal
restored the phlogiston. There was much plausibility
in all this, as well as in the reasoning which
followed. Since we may employ, with equal success,
any kind of combustible body for the purpose
of changing phosphoric acid into phosphorus, such
as lamp-black, sugar, resin, or even several of the
metals, it was concluded that all such bodies contain
a common principle which they communicate to the
phosphoric acid; and since the new body formed is
in all cases identical, the principle communicated
must also be identical. Hence combustible bodies
contain an identical principle, and this principle is
Phlogiston.</p>

<p>The same theory applied with equal force to the
burning of sulphur and several of the metals, and to
their reconversion by combustible bodies.</p>

<p>When lead is kept nearly at a red-heat in the open
air for some time, it is converted into a pigment
called <em>red lead</em>; this is a calx of lead. To restore
this calx again to metallic lead, it is only necessary
to heat it in contact with almost any combustible
matter; all these bodies therefore must contain one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
common principle, which they communicated to the
red lead, and by so doing reconverted it to the state
of metal. Metals then were regarded as compounds
of <em>calces</em> and phlogiston. Thus far the theory works
glibly enough; but now comes a startling fact, which
was long unnoticed by the blind adherents of Stahl,
or, if noticed, intentionally overlooked. It was observed
very early, that when a metal was converted
into a calx, its weight was increased. When this
difficulty first forced itself upon the attention of the
Phlogistians, it was necessary that they should either
explain it, or at once abandon their theory. They
accordingly endeavoured to evade the difficulty, not
only by asserting that phlogiston had no weight, but
that it was actually endowed with a principle of
levity.</p>

<p>It was not possible, however, that any rational
notions should have been entertained upon the subject
of combustion, at a period when the composition
of the atmosphere even was unknown. Let us therefore
follow the stream of discovery, skimming the
surface merely, as it flowed onward towards quite
a new field of science&mdash;Pneumatic Chemistry.</p>

<p>Boyle and Hooke, who had improved the air-pump
invented by Otto de Guericke, of Madenburgh,
first used this apparatus for investigating the
properties of air; and they concluded from their experiments
that air was absolutely necessary to combustion
and respiration, and that one part of it only
was employed in these processes; and Hooke formed
the sagacious conclusion, that this principle is the
same as the substance fixed in nitre, and that combustion
is a chemical process, the solution of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
burning body in elastic fluid, or its union with this
matter.</p>

<p>Mayow, of Oxford, in 1674, published his treatises
on the Nitro-aërial spirit, in which he advanced
opinions similar to those of Boyle and Hooke, and
supported them by a number of original and curious
experiments.</p>

<p>Dr. Hales, about 1724, resumed the investigations
commenced with so much success by Boyle, Hooke,
and Mayow; and endeavoured to ascertain the
chemical relations of air to other substances, and to
ascertain by statistical experiments the cases in nature,
in which it is absorbed or emitted. He obtained
a number of curious and important results;
he disengaged elastic fluids from various substances,
and drew the conclusion, that air was a chemical
element in many compound bodies, and that flame
resulted from the action and reaction of aërial and
sulphurous particles; but all his reasonings were
contaminated with the notion of one elementary
principle constituting elastic matter, and modified
in its properties by the effluvia of solid or fluid
bodies.</p>

<p>The light of Pneumatic science which had
dawned under Hooke, Mayow, and Hales, burst
forth in splendour under the ascendency of that
constellation of British science, Black, Cavendish,
and Priestley.</p>

<p>In 1756, Dr. Black published his researches on
calcareous, magnesian, and alkaline substances, by
which he proved the existence of a gaseous body,
perfectly distinct from the air of the atmosphere.
He showed, that quick-lime differed from marble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
and chalk by not containing this substance, which
he proved to be a weak acid, capable of being expelled
from alkaline and earthy bodies by stronger
acids.</p>

<p>As nothing is more instructive than to enquire
into the circumstances which have led to a great
discovery, I quote with pleasure the following passage
from Dr. Thomson's History of Chemistry.</p>

<p>"It was the good fortune of chemical science
that, at this time (1751), the opinions of professors
were divided concerning the manner in which certain
lithonthriptic medicines, particularly lime-water,
acted in alleviating the excruciating pains of the
stone and gravel. The students usually partake of
such differences of opinion: they are thereby animated
to more serious study, and science gains by
their emulation.</p>

<p>"All the medicines which were then in vogue as
solvents of calculi had a greater or less resemblance
to caustic potash or soda; substances so acrid, when
in a concentrated state, that in a short time they reduce
the fleshy parts of the animal body to a mere
pulp. They all seemed to derive their efficacy from
quick-lime, which again derived its power from the
fire. It was therefore very natural for them to
ascribe its power to igneous matter imbibed from
the fire, retained by the lime, and communicated by
it to alkalies which it renders powerfully acrid. It
appears from Dr. Black's note-books, that he originally
entertained the opinion, that caustic alkalies
acquired igneous matter from quick-lime. In one
of them, he hints at some way of catching this matter
as it escapes from lime, while it becomes mild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
by exposure to the air; but on the opposite blank
page is written, 'Nothing escapes&mdash;the cup rises
considerably by absorbing air.' A few pages further
on, he compares the loss of weight sustained by an
ounce of chalk when calcined, with its loss while
dissolved in muriatic acid.</p>

<p>"These experiments laid open the whole mystery,
as appears by another memorandum. 'When
I precipitate lime by a common alkali, there is no
effervescence: the air quits the alkali for the lime;
but it is lime no longer, but c. c. c: it now effervesces,
which good lime will not.'&mdash;What a multitude
of important consequences naturally flowed
from this discovery! He now knew to what the
causticity of alkalies is owing, and how to induce it,
or remove it, at pleasure. The common notion was
entirely reversed. Lime imparts nothing to the
alkalies; it only removes from them a peculiar kind
of air (<em>carbonic acid gas</em>) with which they were
combined, and which prevented their natural caustic
properties from being developed. All the former
mysteries disappear, and the greatest simplicity appears
in those operations of nature which before
appeared so intricate and obscure."</p>

<p>Dr. Thomson afterwards observes,&mdash;"The discovery
which Dr. Black had made, that marble is a
combination of lime and a peculiar substance, to
which he gave the name of <em>fixed air</em>, began gradually
to attract the attention of chemists in other
parts of the world. It was natural, in the first place,
to examine the nature and properties of this fixed
air, and the circumstances under which it is generated.
It may seem strange and unaccountable that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
Dr. Black did not enter with ardour into this new
career which he had himself opened, and that he
allowed others to reap the corn after having himself
sown the grain. Yet he did take some steps towards
ascertaining the properties of <em>fixed air</em>; though
I am not certain what progress he made. He knew
that a candle would not burn in it, and that it is
destructive to life, when any living animal attempts
to breathe it. He knew that it is formed in the
lungs during the breathing of animals, and that it
is generated during the fermentation of wine and
beer. Whether he was aware that it possesses the
properties of an acid, I do not know; though with
the knowledge which he possessed that it combines
with alkalies and alkaline earths, and neutralizes
them, or at least blunts and diminishes their alkaline
properties, the conclusion that it partook of acid
properties was scarcely avoidable. All these, and
probably some other properties of <em>fixed air</em>, he was
in the constant habit of stating in his lectures from
the very commencement of his academical career;
though, as he never published any thing on the
subject himself, it is not possible to know exactly
how far his knowledge of the properties of <em>fixed air</em>
extended. The oldest manuscript copy of his lectures
that I have seen was taken down in writing in
the year 1773; and before that time Mr. Cavendish
had published his paper on <em>fixed air</em> and <em>hydrogen
gas</em>, and had detailed the properties of each. It
was impossible from the manuscript of Dr. Black's
lectures, to know which of the properties of <em>fixed
air</em> stated by him were discovered by himself, and
which were taken from Mr. Cavendish."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
An idea so novel and important as that of an air
possessing properties quite different from that of
the atmosphere, existing in a fixed and solid state in
various bodies, was not received without doubt, and
even opposition. Several German enquirers endeavoured
to controvert it. Meyer attempted to show
that limestone became caustic, not by the emission
of elastic matter, but by combining with a peculiar
substance in the fire; the loss of weight, however,
was wholly inconsistent with such a view of the
question: and Bergman at Upsal, Macbride in Ireland,
Keir at Birmingham, and Cavendish in London,
fully demonstrated the truth of the opinion of
Black, and a few years were sufficient to establish
his theory upon an immutable foundation, and to
open a new road to most important discoveries.</p>

<p>The knowledge of one elastic fluid, entirely different
in its properties from air, very naturally suggested
the probability of the existence of others.
The processes of fermentation which had been observed
by the ancient chemists, and those by which
Hales had disengaged and collected elastic substances,
were now regarded under a novel point of
view; and the consequence was, that a number of
new bodies, possessed of very extraordinary properties,
were discovered.</p>

<p>Mr. Cavendish, about the year 1765, invented an
apparatus for examining elastic fluids confined by
water, which has since been called the <em>hydro-pneumatic</em>
apparatus. He discovered inflammable air,
and described its properties; he ascertained the relative
weights of fixed air, inflammable air, and
common air, and made a number of beautiful and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
accurate experiments on the properties of these
elastic substances.</p>

<p>Dr. Priestley, in 1771, entered the same path of
enquiry; and principally by repeating the processes
of Hales, added a number of most important facts
to this department of chemical philosophy. He discovered
nitrous air, nitrous oxide, and dephlogisticated
air, (oxygen) and by substituting mercury
for water in the pneumatic apparatus, ascertained
the existence of several aëriform bodies which are
rapidly absorbable by water; such as muriatic acid
gas, sulphurous acid gas, and ammonia.</p>

<p>Scheele, independently of Priestley, also discovered
several of the aëriform bodies; he ascertained likewise
the composition of the atmosphere; he brought
to light fluoric acid, prussic acid, and the substance
which he termed <em>dephlogisticated marine acid</em>, the
oxy-muriatic acid of the French school, and the
chlorine of Davy.</p>

<p>Sir Humphry Davy, in the preface to his Chemical
Philosophy, observes that Black, Cavendish,
Priestley, and Scheele, were undoubtedly the greatest
chemical discoverers of the eighteenth century;
and that their merits are distinct, peculiar, and of
the most exalted kind. He thus defines them:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Black</span> made a smaller number of original experiments
than either of the other philosophers; but
being the first labourer in this new department of
the science, he had greater difficulties to overcome.
His methods are distinguished for their simplicity;
his reasonings are admirable for their precision; and
his modest, clear, and unaffected manner is well calculated
to impress upon the mind a conviction of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
the accuracy of his processes, and the truth and candour
of his researches.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Cavendish</span> was possessed of a minute knowledge
of most of the departments of Natural Philosophy:
he carried into his chemical researches a
delicacy and precision, which have never been exceeded:
possessing depth and extent of mathematical
knowledge, he reasoned with the caution of a
geometer upon the results of his experiments; and
it may be said of him, what, perhaps, can scarcely be
said of any other person, that whatever he accomplished,
was perfect at the moment of its production.
His processes were all of a finished nature;
executed by the hand of a master, they required no
correction; the accuracy and beauty of his earliest
labours even have remained unimpaired amidst the
progress of discovery, and their merits have been
illustrated by discussion and exalted by time.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dr. Priestley</span> began his career of discovery
without any general knowledge of chemistry, and
with a very imperfect apparatus. His characteristics
were ardent zeal and the most unwearied industry.
He exposed all the substances he could
procure to chemical agencies, and brought forward
his results as they occurred, without attempting logical
method or scientific arrangement. His hypotheses
were usually founded upon a few loose analogies;
but he changed them with facility; and being
framed without much effort, they were relinquished
with little regret. He possessed in the highest degree
ingenuousness and the love of truth. His manipulations,
though never very refined, were always
simple, and often ingenious. Chemistry owes to him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
some of her most important instruments of research,
and many of her most useful combinations; and no
single person ever discovered so many new and curious
substances.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Scheele</span> possessed in the highest degree the
faculty of invention; all his labours were instituted
with an object in view, and after happy or bold
analogies. He owed little to fortune or to accidental
circumstances: born in an obscure situation,
occupied in the duties of an irksome employment,
nothing could damp the ardour of his mind, or chill
the fire of his genius; with very small means, he
accomplished very great things. No difficulties deterred
him from submitting his ideas to the test of
experiment. Occasionally misled in his views, in
consequence of the imperfection of his apparatus, or
the infant state of the enquiry, he never hesitated to
give up his opinions the moment they were contradicted
by facts. He was eminently endowed with
that candour which is characteristic of great minds,
and which induces them to rejoice as well in the
detection of their own errors, as in the discovery of
truth. His papers are admirable models of the
manner in which experimental research ought to be
pursued; and they contain details on some of the
most important and brilliant phenomena of chemical
philosophy."</p>

<p>The discovery of the gases, of a new class of
bodies more active than any others in most of the
phenomena of nature and art, could not fail to
modify the whole theory of chemistry, and, under
the genius of Lavoisier, it ultimately led to the
establishment of those new doctrines, which it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
the principal object of this history to expound; but
before this task can be accomplished, it will be necessary
to consider the rise and progress of opinion
concerning chemical attraction, and heat and light,
since these subjects are too intimately interwoven
with the <em>anti-phlogistic</em> system to be separated from
any examination of its principles.</p>

<p>Boyle, says Sir Humphry Davy, was one of the
most active experimenters, and certainly the greatest
chemist of his age. He introduced the use of <em>tests</em>,
or <em>re-agents</em>, active substances for detecting the
presence of other bodies: he overturned the ideas
which at that time were prevalent, that the results
of operations by fire were the real elements of things;
and he ascertained a number of important facts respecting
inflammable bodies, and alkalies, and the
phenomena of combination; but neither he nor any
of his contemporaries endeavoured to account for the
changes of bodies by any fixed principles.</p>

<p>The solutions of the phenomena were attempted
either on rude mechanical notions, or by occult qualities,
or peculiar subtile spirits or ethers, supposed to
exist in the different bodies. And it is to the same
great genius who developed the laws that regulate
the motions of the heavenly bodies, that chemistry
owes the first distinct philosophical elucidations of
the powers which produce the changes and apparent
transmutations of the substances belonging to the
earth.</p>

<p>"Sugar dissolves in water, alkalies unite with
acids, metals dissolve in acids. Is not this," says
Newton, "on account of an attraction between their
particles? Copper dissolved in aqua fortis is thrown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
down by iron. Is not this because the particles of
the iron have a stronger attraction for the particles
of the acid, than those of copper; and do not different
bodies attract each other with different degrees
of force?"</p>

<p>In 1719, Geoffroy endeavoured to ascertain the
relative attractive powers of bodies for each other,
and to arrange them, under the form of a table, in
an order in which these forces, which he named
affinities, were expressed.</p>

<p>Concerning the nature of heat, there are two opinions
which have ever divided the chemical world.
The one considers it merely as a property of matter,
and that it consists in an undefinable motion, or
vibration of its particles; the other, on the contrary,
regards it as a distinct and subtile substance, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui
generis</i>. Each of these opinions has been supported
by the greatest philosophers, and for a long period
the arguments on both sides appeared equally plausible
and forcible. The discovery of Dr. Black, however,
gave a preponderance to the scale in favour
of its materiality.</p>

<p>"It was during his residence in Glasgow, between
the year 1759 and 1763," says Dr. Thomson, "that
he brought to maturity those speculations concerning
the combination of <em>heat</em> with <em>matter</em>, which had
frequently occupied a portion of his thoughts."</p>

<p>Before Dr. Black's discovery, it was universally
supposed that solids were converted into liquids
by a small addition of heat, after they have been
once raised to the melting point, and that they
returned again to the solid state on a very small
diminution of the quantity of heat necessary to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
keep them at that temperature. An attentive view,
however, of the phenomena of liquefaction and
solidification gradually led this sagacious philosopher
to a different conclusion. By observations
which it is unnecessary to detail, he became satisfied
that when ice is converted into water, it unites
with a quantity of heat, without having its temperature
increased; and that when water is frozen
into ice, it gives out a quantity of heat without
having it diminished. The heat thus combined,
then, is the cause of the fluidity of the water; and
as it is not sensible to the thermometer, Dr. Black
called it <em>latent heat</em>.</p>

<p>There is such an analogy between the cessation of
thermometric expansion during the liquefaction of
ice, and during the conversion of water into steam,
that there could be no hesitation about explaining
both in the same way. Dr. Black, therefore, immediately
concluded that, as water is ice united to a
certain quantity of <em>latent</em> heat, so steam is water
united to a still greater quantity.</p>

<p>This beautiful theory enables us to understand
phenomena in nature which were previously quite
inexplicable. We now comprehend how the thaw
which supervenes after intense frost, should so slowly
melt the wreaths of snow and beds of ice. Had,
indeed, the transition of water from its solid into its
liquid state not been accompanied by this great
change in its relation to heat, every thaw would have
occasioned a frightful inundation, and a single night's
frost must have solidified our rivers and lakes. Neither
animal nor vegetable life could have subsisted
under such sudden and violent transitions. It would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
appear, then, that water, during the act of freezing,
is acted upon by two opposite powers: it is deprived
of heat by exposure to a medium whose temperature
is below 32°; and it is supplied with heat by the
evolution of that principle from itself, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i> of that
portion which constituted its fluidity. As these
powers are exactly equal, the temperature of the
water must remain unchanged till the latent heat,
necessary to its fluidity, is all evolved.</p>

<p>Although these facts have been admitted by
all, it has been contended by many that the absorption
of heat by bodies is the necessary <em>effect</em>, and
not the efficient <em>cause</em>, of change of form,&mdash;the consequence
of what has been called a change of their
<em>capacity</em>: thus ice, it is supposed, in becoming water,
has its capacity for heat increased, and the absorption
of heat is a consequence of such increased capacity.
This theory, however, is deficient, inasmuch as it
fails to explain the cause of that change of form,
which is assumed to account for the increase of
capacity.</p>

<p>Light, like heat, has been considered by some
philosophers as a subtile fluid filling space, and rendering
bodies visible by the undulations into which
it is thrown; while others, with Newton at their
head, regard it as a substance consisting of small
particles, constantly separating from luminous bodies,
moving in straight lines, and rendering objects
visible by passing from them and entering the eye.
The late experiments of Dr. Young would incline
us to prefer the undulatory to the corpuscular
hypothesis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
By this preliminary sketch, the reader has been
prepared for viewing with advantage the theory of
Lavoisier; in the construction of which he will see
little more than a happy generalization of the several
discoveries which have been enumerated. Indeed,
this observation will apply to all great systems of
philosophy; facts, developed by successive enquirers,
go on accumulating, until, after an interval, a happy
genius arises who connects and links them together;
and thus generally receives that meed of praise
which, in stricter justice, would be apportioned and
awarded to the separate contributors. It is far from
my intention to disparage the merits of Lavoisier;
but the materials of his system were undoubtedly
furnished by Black, Priestley, and Cavendish.</p>

<p>The most important modification of the phlogistic
theory&mdash;for there were several others&mdash;may be said
to be that suggested by Dr. Crawford. Dr. Priestley
had found that the air in which combustibles
were suffered to burn till they were extinguished,
underwent a very remarkable change, for no combustible
would afterwards burn in it, and no animal
could breathe it without suffocation. Dr. Crawford,
like many others, concluded, that this change was
owing to phlogiston; but he for the first time
applied Dr. Black's doctrine of <em>latent</em> heat, for the
explanation of the origin of the heat and light
which appear during the process. According to this
philosopher, the phlogiston of the combustible combines,
during combustion, with the air, and at the
same time separates the caloric and light with which
that fluid had been previously united. The heat
and the light, then, which appear during combustion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
exist previously in the air. This theory was
very different from Stahl's, and certainly a great
deal more satisfactory; but still the question&mdash;<em>What
is phlogiston?</em> remained to be answered.</p>

<p>Mr. Kirwan attempted to answer it, and to prove
that phlogiston is no other than hydrogen.</p>

<p>This opinion, which Mr. Kirwan informs us was
first suggested by the discoveries of Dr. Priestley,
met with a very favourable reception from the chemical
world, and was adopted, amongst many others,
by Mr. Cavendish. The object of Mr. Kirwan was
to prove, that hydrogen exists as a component part
of every combustible body; that during combustion
it separates from the combustible body, and
combines with the oxygen of the air. At the same
time, Lavoisier was engaged in examining the experiment
of Bayen, and those of the British philosophers.
Bayen, in 1774, had shown that mercury
converted into a calx, or earth, by the absorption of
air, could be revived without the addition of any
inflammable substance; and hence he concluded,
that there was no necessity for supposing the existence
of any peculiar principle of inflammability, in
order to account for the calcination of metals; but
he formed no opinion respecting the nature of the
air produced from the <em>calx</em> of mercury. Lavoisier,
in 1775, showed that it was an air, which supported
flame and respiration better than common air, which
he afterwards named oxygen: the same substance
that Priestley and Scheele had procured from other
metallic bodies the year before, and had particularly
described.</p>

<p>Lavoisier also discovered that the same air is produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
during the revivification of metallic calces by
charcoal, as that which is emitted during the calcination
of limestones; hence he concluded, that this
elastic fluid is composed of oxygen and charcoal:
and from his experiments on nitrous acid and oil of
vitriol, he also inferred that this gas entered into the
composition of these substances.</p>

<p>Lavoisier was now enabled to explain the phenomena
of combustion, without having recourse, to
phlogiston: a principle merely supposed to exist,
because combustion could not be explained without
it.</p>

<p>His new theory depends upon the two laws discovered
by himself and Dr. Black; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i> that when a
combustible is raised to a certain temperature, it
begins to combine with the oxygen of the atmosphere,
and that this oxygen during its condensation
lets go the <em>latent</em> caloric, and the light with
which it was combined while in the gaseous state.
Hence their appearance during every combustion.
Hence also the change which the combustible undergoes
in consequence of combustion.</p>

<p>It followed from this view, that the metallic <em>calces</em>
were combinations of metals with oxygen; and on
examining the products of certain inflammable
bodies, and finding them to be acid, the conclusion
was extended by a plausible analogy to other acids
whose bases were unknown, and the general proposition
was established that oxygen was the universal
principle of acidity; that acids resulted from
the union of a peculiar combustible base, called the
<em>radical</em>, with the common principle, oxygen, technically
termed the <em>acidifier</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
These views, regarding the phenomena of combustion
and acidification, may be considered as constituting
what has been termed the <em>Anti-phlogistic
system</em>.</p>

<p>It was some time, however, after this system was
promulgated, before its author was able to gain a
single convert, notwithstanding his unwearied assiduity,
and the great weight which his talents, his
reputation, his fortune, and his situation naturally
gave him.</p>

<p>At length, M. Berthollet, at a meeting of the
Academy of Sciences in 1785, solemnly renounced
his old opinions, and declared himself a convert.
Fourcroy followed his example; and two years afterwards
Morveau, during a visit to Paris, was prevailed
upon to embrace the new doctrine.</p>

<p>The theory of Lavoisier, soon after it had been
framed, received an important confirmation from the
two grand discoveries of Mr. Cavendish, respecting
the composition of water and nitric acid, and the
elaborate and beautiful investigations of Berthollet
into the nature of ammonia; by which, phenomena,
before anomalous, were shown to depend upon combinations
of aëriform matter.</p>

<p>The notion of phlogiston, however, was still defended
with remarkable tenacity by many distinguished
philosophers. Mr. Kirwan, who considered
hydrogen as the universal principle of combustibility,
undertook to prove that this element entered
into the composition of every body of the kind: a
single exception, of course, must necessarily prove
fatal to the theory. Mr. Kirwan, fortunately for
the French chemists, founded his reasonings on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
inaccurate experiments of other chemists; and thus
did he promote the popularity of the anti-phlogistic
system by the weakness of the arguments by which
he assailed it.</p>

<p>Lavoisier and his associates saw at once the important
uses which might be made of this essay: by
refuting an hypothesis which had been embraced by
the most respectable chemists in Europe, their cause
would receive an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éclat</i> which would make it irresistible.
The essay was accordingly translated into
French, and each of the sections into which it was
divided was accompanied by a refutation.</p>

<p>Four of the sections were refuted by Lavoisier,
three by Berthollet, three by Fourcroy, two by
Morveau, and one by Monge.</p>

<p>Mr. Cavendish, in a paper communicated to the
Royal Society in the year 1784, drew a comparison
between the phlogistic and anti-phlogistic theories,
and showed that each of them was capable of explaining
the phenomena in a satisfactory manner; he
however, at the same time, gave the reasons which
induced him to prefer the earlier view. In the execution
of this task, unlike Mr. Kirwan, he never
advanced a single opinion which he had not put to
the test of experiment; and he never suffered himself
to go any farther than his experiments would
warrant. This paper, therefore, the French chemists
were unable to refute, and they were accordingly
wise enough to pass it over without notice. Had it
been possible to have preserved the phlogistic hypothesis,
Mr. Cavendish would have saved it&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
"Sooner or later," says Sir Humphry Davy, "that
doctrine which is an expression of facts, must prevail
over that which is an expression of opinion.
The most important part of the theory of Lavoisier
was merely an arrangement of the facts relating
to the combinations of oxygen: the principle of
reasoning which the French school professed to
adopt was, that every body which was not yet decompounded,
should be considered as simple; and
though mistakes were made with respect to the results
of experiments on the nature of bodies, yet
this logical and truly philosophical principle was not
violated; and the systematic manner in which it
was enforced was of the greatest use in promoting
the progress of science."</p>

<p>Till 1786, there had been no attempt to reform
the nomenclature of chemistry; the names applied
by discoverers to the substances which they made
known were still employed. Some of these names,
which originated amongst the alchymists, were of
the most barbarous kind; few of them were sufficiently
definite or precise, and most of them were
founded upon loose analogies, or upon false theoretical
views.</p>

<p>"It was felt by many philosophers, particularly
by the illustrious Bergman, that an improvement in
chemical nomenclature was necessary; and in 1787,
MM. Lavoisier, Morveau, Berthollet, and Fourcroy,
presented to the world a plan for an almost entire
change in the denomination of chemical substances,
founded upon the idea of calling simple bodies by
some names characteristic of their most striking
qualities, and of naming compound bodies from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
elements which composed them." There was, besides,
a secret feeling in the breasts of the associated
chemists, which, no doubt, had its influence in suggesting
and promoting such a scheme. The views
of Lavoisier had so changed the face of chemistry,
as almost to have rendered it a new science: by
adopting a new nomenclature, they identified, as it
were, all the discoveries of the day with the new
theory, and thus appropriated to France the original
and entire merit of the system.</p>

<p>It is impossible to pass over this subject without
a comment. Lavoisier was unquestionably indebted
to Dr. Black for the support, if not for the suggestion,
of the most brilliant part of his theory of
combustion; and yet he attempted even to conceal
the name of the discoverer of <em>latent heat</em>.</p>

<p>How far Lavoisier was really culpable, and whether
he did not intend to do full justice to all the
claims of his predecessors, cannot now be known; as
he was cut off in the midst of his career, while so
many of his scientific projects remained unexecuted.
From the posthumous works of Lavoisier, there is
some reason for believing that, if he had lived, he
would have done justice to all parties; but there is
no doubt that Dr. Black, in the mean time, thought
himself aggrieved by the publication of several of
Lavoisier's papers in the "Mémoires de l'Académie,"
and that he formed the intention of doing himself
justice, by publishing an account of his own discoveries:
this intention, however, was unfortunately
thwarted and prevented by bad health. But to
return to the subject of nomenclature. Sir H. Davy
continues&mdash;"The new nomenclature was speedily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
adopted in France; under some modifications, it
was received in Germany; and, after much discussion
and opposition, it became the language of a
new and rising generation of chemists in England.
It materially assisted the diffusion of the anti-phlogistic
doctrine, and even facilitated the general acquisition
of the science; and many of its details
were contrived with much address, and were worthy
of its celebrated authors."</p>

<p>On the general adoption of this new theory of
chemistry, it must be admitted that its authors displayed
an intemperate triumph wholly unworthy of
them. They held a festival, at which Madame Lavoisier,
in the habit of a priestess, burnt the works of
Stahl on an altar erected for the occasion, while solemn
music played a requiem to his departed system!</p>

<p>Sir Humphry Davy, in speaking of the merits of
Lavoisier, observes that "he must be regarded as
one of the most sagacious of the chemical philosophers
of the last century; indeed, except Cavendish,
there is no other enquirer who can be compared to
him for precision of logic, extent of view, and sagacity
of induction. His discoveries are few, but he
reasoned with extraordinary correctness upon the
labours of others. He introduced weight and measure,
and strict accuracy of manipulation into all
chemical processes. His mind was unbiassed by
prejudice; his combinations were of the most philosophical
nature; and in his investigations upon ponderable
substances, he has entered the true path of
experiment with cautious steps, following just analogies,
and measuring hypotheses by their simple
relations to facts."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
It will be scarcely possible for a future generation
of philosophers to imagine with what an undisciplined
ardour the anti-phlogistic system, thus enhanced
by a new and fascinating nomenclature, was
supported throughout Europe. Facts only were
appreciated in proportion to the evidence they furnished
of its truth; and a discovery even required
the sanction of its authority as the passport to notice
and regard. The least expression of doubt, as
to the validity of any point in its doctrines, exposed
the sceptic to a host of assailants, and fortunate was
he if he escaped the fate of Peter Ramus, or of
those who ventured to question the infallibility of
that great despot of another age, Aristotle.</p>

<p>In no country of Europe did this feeling manifest
itself to a greater extent than in England.
There was perhaps a political prejudice co-operating
upon the occasion: it is very difficult, under any
circumstances, to avoid connecting the man and his
works. The fate of Lavoisier<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> was truly affecting,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
and by a species of retributive justice, he received
the sympathy of the world in the homage paid to
his system; while the atrocity of his assassination,
on which every Englishman dwelt with horror,
appeared to be thus heightened by every praise bestowed
upon his merits.</p>

<p>It is not the least surprising circumstance in the
history of this system, that with such a blind and
idolatrous admiration of its principles, so few facts
should have been distorted. It is true that, from
the belief that combustion could never take place
without the presence of oxygen, the elementary
principle of Scheele became, according to these
views, a compound of oxygen and an acid; and the
name of <em>dephlogisticated marine acid</em> was exchanged
for that of <em>oxy-muriatic acid</em>, a circumstance which
spread a cloud of error over the science, and perhaps
retarded its progress in a greater degree than is
generally imagined. In like manner, the chemist
neglected to avail himself of the hint which, under
other impressions, would have proved an important
clue to discovery, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i> the acid properties of sulphuretted
hydrogen.</p>

<p>We have now arrived at that stage in our history,
when it may with propriety and advantage be asked&mdash;<span class="smcap">What
has Davy done in correcting error,
or in advancing truth?</span></p>

<p>The answer to this question will be nothing more
than a summary of those discoveries which have
been successively investigated during the progress
of the present work.</p>

<p>The new doctrines of chemistry were highly instrumental
in encouraging more extended investigations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
into all the different productions of nature and
art; and we may observe, that one of the first
efforts of Sir Humphry Davy was to improve our
knowledge of the nature and habitudes of the tanning
and astringent principles of vegetables,&mdash;an
enquiry which had been commenced by Seguin and
Proust. In pursuing even the most beaten path,
he was sure to discover objects of novelty. Look
at his early experiments on the cane, and on the
straw of wheat, barley, and hay, and we shall see
how magically he raised from their ashes a new
flower of knowledge. He soon, however, quitted
the track of other experimentalists; although we
learn from the whole tenor of his researches, that he
could obey as well as he could command, and he
could act in the ranks, although he more frequently
appeared as a general in the field of science.</p>

<p>Sir Humphry Davy has observed, that "at the
time when the anti-phlogistic theory was established,
electricity had little or no relation to chemistry.
The grand results of Franklin respecting the cause
of lightning, had led many philosophers to conjecture,
that certain chemical changes in the atmosphere
might be connected with electrical phenomena;
and electrical discharges had been employed
by Cavendish, Priestley, and Van-Marum, for decomposing
and igniting bodies; but it was not till
the era of the wonderful discovery of Volta, in
1800, of a new electrical apparatus, that any great
progress was made in chemical investigation by
means of electrical combinations.</p>

<p>"Nothing tends so much to the advancement of
knowledge as the application of a new instrument.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
The native intellectual powers of men in different
times are not so much the causes of the different
success of their labours, as the peculiar nature of the
means and artificial resources in their possession.
Independent of vessels of glass, there could have
been no accurate manipulations in common chemistry:
the air-pump was necessary for the investigation
of the properties of gaseous matter; and without
the Voltaic apparatus, there was no possibility
of examining the relations of electrical polarities to
chemical attractions."</p>

<p>There is a candour in this statement which we
cannot but admire. Nor does the admission diminish
the glory of him who, by the application of
such new instruments of research, was enabled to
penetrate into the hidden mysteries of Nature.
What avails the telescope, without the eye of the
observer?</p>

<p>To Davy, the Voltaic apparatus was the <em>golden
branch</em>, by which he subdued the spirits that had
opposed the advance of former philosophers; but
what would its possession have availed him, had not
his genius, like the ancient Sibyl, pointed out its
use and application?</p>

<p>It will be seen that he was thus enabled, not only
to discover laws which are in constant operation,
modifying the forms of matter, and influencing all
the operations of chemistry, but, by applying them,
to determine the elements of the fixed alkalies to
be oxygen and a metallic base: a fact obviously opposed
to the idea of oxygen being the general principle
of acidity; for here it was the principle of
alkalinity, if it may be so expressed. This was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
shaking the corner-stone of the edifice, and his subsequent
researches into the nature of oxy-muriatic
acid may be said to have overthrown it; for if either
of the elements of this body can be considered as the
acidifier, it is hydrogen. The consequences which
flowed from this truth were of the highest importance,
not only in correcting errors, which the progress
of discovery, instead of rectifying, was actually
multiplying, but in leading to the developement
of new bodies. Iodine might have been recognised
as an elementary body; but its relations
to oxygen and hydrogen would probably have remained
unknown, had not a knowledge of the true
character of chlorine assisted the enquiry.</p>

<p>The same observation will apply to the recently
discovered body, Bromine. In like manner has the
chemist been led, by the chloridic theory, to a more
accurate acquaintance with the composition of the
fluoric, hydriodic, and hydrocyanic acids; while he
has also learnt that hydrogen alone can convert certain
undecompounded bases into well characterised
acids, without the aid of oxygen. The same discovery
has completely changed all our opinions with
regard to a very important series of saline combinations,
and developed the existence of new compounds
of a most interesting description.</p>

<p>Thus, then, has the <em>acidifying</em> hypothesis of Lavoisier
been overturned, and a new theory constructed
out of its ruins, which acknowledges no
distinct element as the one imparting to matter the
characters of an acid.</p>

<p>Equally complete has been the downfall of the
theory of combustion. The discovery of the true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
nature of chlorine was, in itself, sufficient to show
that bodies might combine, with the phenomena of
heat and light, without the presence of oxygen; but
Davy has brought a mass of evidence from other
sources in proof of the same truth. He has shown
that, whenever the chemical forces which determine
either composition or decomposition are energetically
exercised, the phenomena of combustion,
or incandescence, with a change of properties, are
displayed. He has therefore annulled the distinction
between supporters of combustion and combustibles,
since he has shown that, in fact, one substance
frequently acts in both capacities, being a
supporter <em>apparently</em> at one time, and a combustible
at another. But in both cases the heat and light
depend on the same cause, and merely indicate the
energy and rapidity with which reciprocal attractions
are exerted. Thus sulphuretted hydrogen is
a combustible with oxygen and chlorine; a supporter
with potassium. Sulphur, with chlorine and
oxygen, has been called a combustible basis; with
metals, it acts the part of a supporter. In like
manner, potassium unites so powerfully with arsenic
and tellurium, as to produce the phenomena of combustion.
Nor can we ascribe the appearances to the
liberation of latent heat, in consequence of condensation
of volume. The protoxide of chlorine, a body
destitute of any combustible constituent, at the instant
of decomposition evolves light and heat with
explosive violence; and its volume becomes one-fifth
greater. Chloride and iodide of azote, compounds
alike destitute of any inflammable matter,
according to the ordinary belief, are resolved into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
their respective elements with tremendous force of
inflammation; and the first expands into more than
six hundred times its bulk. Now, instead of heat
and light, a prodigious degree of <em>cold</em> ought to
accompany such an expansion, according to the
hypothesis of latent heat. Other instances might
be cited, and other arguments adduced on the same
subject, but time and space fail me.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>Such, then, are the facts developed by the experimental
researches of Sir Humphry Davy; from
which it follows, that&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Combustion is not necessarily dependent on
the agency of oxygen.</p>

<p>2. That it cannot be regarded as dependent upon
any peculiar principle or form of matter, but must
be considered as a general result of intense chemical
action.</p>

<p>3. That the evolution of light and heat cannot be
ascribed simply to a gas parting with its latent store
of those ethereal fluids.</p>

<p>4. That, since all bodies which act powerfully
upon each other are in the opposite electrical relations
of positive and negative, the evolution of heat
and light may depend upon the annihilation of these
opposite states, which will happen whenever they
combine.</p>

<p>Thus has Sir H. Davy, by refuting the opinions
of the French philosophers, respecting the relations
of oxygen to the phenomena of combustion, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
nature of its products, removed the pillars on which
the fabric of the anti-phlogistic rested, and reduced
the generalization of Lavoisier to isolated collections
of facts; the sound logic, however,&mdash;the pure
candour, the numerical precision of inference which
characterise the labours of the French philosopher,
will cause his name to be held in everlasting admiration.
The downfall of his doctrine is the natural
result of the progress of truth; the same fate may
attend our present systems, but the facts discovered
through their means are unchangeable and eternal;
and it is upon them alone that the fame of the
chemist must ultimately rest.</p>

<p>In sciences collateral to chemistry, the researches
of Davy have cast a reflected lustre. In geology,
his discovery of the composition of the earths, has
opened a new path of investigation; while his
examination of the water and gaseous matter so
frequently enclosed in the cavities of quartz, has
given no small degree of support to the hypothesis
of the Plutonists; above all, his results connected
with the decomposition and transfer of different
elements by Voltaic influence, has already explained
many phenomena relating to metallic veins; and
the late researches of Mr. Fox must lead us to the
conclusion, that electric powers are still in operation
in the recesses of the earth; and that mineral veins
are not only the cabinets of Nature, but still her
active laboratories.</p>

<p>These cursory observations upon the discoveries
of Sir H. Davy relate merely to the changes they
have effected in the general theory of chemistry. I
might recapitulate the numerous researches by which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
he has extended our knowledge upon particular subjects;
but I have so fully entered into the consideration
of them in the body of my work, that I consider
such a tax upon the patience of my reader
would be both unfair and unnecessary.</p>

<p>I shall therefore <em>conclude</em> my long and arduous
labour, by enumerating the different memoirs communicated
by this distinguished philosopher to the
Royal Society; and also the several works which
he published at different periods of his brilliant but
too fleeting career.</p>

<span class="large">MY WILL.</span></p>

<p>This 3rd of January 1827 feeling more than usual symptoms
of mortality I make this my Will. First, I give my
Brother John Davy M.D. three hundred pounds a-year of
money that I possess in the Long Annuities and likewise four
thousand pounds to be raised by the sale of Securities I possess
in the English or French funds or annuities but I mean
my said Brother to devote the interest of three thousand
pound of these last moneys to such purposes as he may deem
fitting for the benefit of my sisters particularly my married
one and I wish a part of the interest of these three thousand
pounds to be employed in educating and settling in life my
godson Humphrey Millett. I leave him Dr. Davy likewise
all the property devolving to me from my parents which has
never been divided to do what seems to him best for the
benefit of my sisters and my sister Millett's children and I
leave my said brother my Chemical Books and Chemical
MSS. Apparatus <em>Sporting tackle</em> Medals and the silver Venetian
dish made from the Rumford Medal in token of my affection.
I leave £100 to each of these friends Dr. Babington
and Dr. Franck and £50 to Dr. Wilson Philip and to Mr.
Brodie surgeon to lay out in tokens of remembrance. I leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
all my other property whether in goods money chattels
funded securities annuities or plate to my wife (Lady) Jane
Davy and I appoint her the sole Executrix of this my Will.
If my brother or his family should not be in a condition at
the time of her decease to use my service of plate given for the
safety lamp I wish it to be sold and the same given to the
Royal Society to provide an annual medal from the interest
for the best discovery made any where in chemistry and I
depend upon my dear wife to make such presents in seals or
token to such of my friends as she may think proper agreeably
to their and her feelings.</p>

<p>I leave to my wife Dame Jane Davy all my other property
whether funded or in government securities or in leases of
houses or goods &amp;c. and I leave her my sole residuary legatee
and sole Executrix. I wish her to enjoy the use of my plate
during her life and that she will leave it to my brother in case
he survive her and if not to any child of his who may be
capable of using it but if he be not in a situation to use or
enjoy it then I wish it to be melted and given to the Royal
Society to found a medal to be given annually for the most
important discovery in Chemistry any where made in Europe
or Anglo-America. Knowing the perfect understanding and
love of justice of my wife I leave to her all other arrangements
which may make my memory useful to the world and
awaken the kind feelings of my friends and I wish her and
my brother and all my friends every happiness this life can
afford.</p>

there should be any doubt respecting the £3000 mentioned
I mean my brother to be a trustee for this and should he die
without children I mean it to belong to my sister Millett's
children £2000 to Humphry Millett my godson and the rest
to be equally divided between the other children but should
my brother marry and have children I then mean after the
death of my sisters these £3000 to be divided between her

<p>By this addition to my will I confirm all that I have willed
in a paper left in a brass box at Messrs. Drummond leaving
Lady Davy my sole Executrix and residuary legatee. I
leave the copyright of Salmonia to my brother John Davy
wishing him to apply a part of the profits of the sale of the
editions of this work to the education of my nephew Humphrey
Millett in case he has no children of his own. I leave
the copy of my Vision in my writing desk to Lady Davy to
be published if my friends think it may give pleasure or information
to the public but I wish the profits of this work to
be applied to the use of my brothers and sisters. I leave to
Josephine Detela daughter of Mr. Detela of Laybach in Illyria
innkeeper my kind and affectionate nurse one hundred
pounds or rather a sum which shall equal a thousand florins
to be paid out of the balance at my banker's within three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
months after my decease. I beg Lady Davy to be so good
as to fulfill my engagements with the persons who are travelling
with me but without any favour as I have no reason to
praise either their attention or civilities within the last two
months but the kindness and attentions of Josephine Detela
during my illness at Laybach not only calls for the testimony
I have given but likewise my gratitude for which I give her
the £100 or the 1000 florins.</p>

I wish £100 to be given to George Whidby and I beg Lady
Davy to fulfill all my engagements and that if my friends
should think my Dialogues worthy of publication I beg that
they may be published and that Mr. Tobin may correct the
press of them and I wish that £150 may be given to him for
this labour. There is a codicil to my will in my writing desk.
I beg Lady Davy to have the goodness to attend to every
thing mentioned in that. In addition to what I have mentioned
in that codicil I request that £50 or 500 florins may
be given to Josephine Dettela within five months after my
decease and I wish £50 to be presented to my friend Dr Morichini
in remembrance and memory of his great kindness

<p>For the purpose of explaining a Will that I made before
I left England and some papers that I have since added to it
I write these few words Rome, March 18, 1829.</p>

<p>I give the copyright of Salmonia my Dialogues and any
other of my works which my friends may think it proper to
republish to my brother John Davy M.D. to be published
in the manner he may think most fit and proper. I have
already in my former testament left Lady Davy my residuary

Davy in case there rests any doubt upon this subject in my
first will and I wish her the said Lady Davy to enjoy during
her life the use and property of the different services of plate
given to me whether by the Emperor of Russia or the different
coal <em>committees</em> but I trust to her sense of justice that

the original documents, that his name was introduced in the very
words which he suggested, and which I have at this moment before

with effects.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">[7]</a> In offering these observations, the reader may readily suppose
it has not been without much pain that I have made this sacrifice
of personal feeling to principle. I am, however, bound to observe,
that Sir Humphry's sentiments towards France for the liberal
indulgence granted to him were both grateful and kindly; and so
strongly does Lady Davy participate in that feeling, that I perhaps
owe it to her to state that neither her Ladyship's journals or information
have been used upon this occasion.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_23" id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="label">[23]</a> Dr. Thomson has calculated that the quantity of coal exported
yearly from this formation exceeds two millions of chaldrons;
and he thinks it may be fairly stated, in round numbers,
that, at the present rate of waste, it will continue to supply coal
for a thousand years! Mr. Phillips, however, is inclined to deduct
a century or two from this calculation.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_24" id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="label">[24]</a> In all large collieries, the air is accelerated through the workings
by placing furnaces, sometimes at the bottom, and sometimes
at the top of the up-cast shaft; in aid of which, at Wall's-end
Colliery, a powerful air-pump worked by a steam-engine is employed
to quicken the draft: this alone draws out of the mines a
thousand hogsheads of air every minute. Stoppings and trapdoors
are also interposed in various parts of the workings, in order
to give a direction to the draft.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[25]</a> Sir James Lowther found a uniform current of this description
produced in one of his mines for the space of two years and nine
months. Phil. Trans, vol. 38. p. 112.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_26" id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="label">[26]</a> Steel-mills are small machines, which give light by turning
a cylinder of steel against a piece of flint. Sir James Lowther had
observed early in the last century, that the fire-damp in its usual
form was not inflammable by sparks from flint and steel; and it
appears that a person in his employment invented the machine in
question.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_27" id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="label">[27]</a> It is unnecessary to enumerate the various schemes that have
been proposed to prevent accidents from fire-damp. Some were
unquestionably of value, and might, by their adoption, have diminished
the frequency of explosions; others were visionary, or
wholly impracticable. It was proposed, for instance, to fill the
mine with an atmosphere of chlorine, which by entering into chemical
union with the carburetted hydrogen, might disarm it of its
power. Dr. Murray, in a paper published in the Transactions of
the Royal Society of Edinburgh, suggests the use of a lamp that
shall be supplied with air from the ground of the pit, by means of
a long flexible tube, upon the false assumption that the fire-damp
alone occupies the higher parts of the mine. Mr. W. Brandling
also constructed a Safe-lamp, which, like that of Dr. Murray, was
fed by air introduced through a long flexible tube reaching to the
floor of the mine. In addition to which, he attached to the top of
the lantern a pair of double bellows, by the aid of which he at the
same time drew out the contaminated air from the interior of the
lamp, and sucked in, through the flexible tube, a fresh portion to
supply its place. To say nothing of the inefficacy and inconvenience
of the long tube, the bellows possessed the additional objection
of frequently puffing out the light.</p>

<p>One of the most active and intelligent members of the "Society
for preventing accidents in Coal Mines," Dr. Clanny, had for some
time paid particular attention to the object in contemplation. He
first suggested the idea of an insulated lamp, of which an account
appeared in the Philosophical Transactions for 1813. In 1815, he
invented a steam safety-lamp, constructed of the strongest tinned
iron, with thick flint glass in front. In this machine, the air of
the coal mine passes in a current through a tube, and mixing with
the steam, before it can arrive at the light, burns steadily in the
wick of the lamp alone. This lamp has the valuable property of
remaining cool. It has been much used in the Herrington Mill
pit, the Whitefield pit, and the Engine pit.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_28" id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="label">[28]</a> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quere</i>&mdash;South Shields.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_29" id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">[29]</a> <em>Olefiant</em> gas, when mixed with such proportions of common
air as to render it explosive, is fired both by charcoal and iron
heated to a dull-red heat. <em>Gaseous oxide of carbon</em>, which explodes
when mixed with two parts of air, is likewise inflammable by red-hot
iron, and charcoal. The case is the same with <em>sulphuretted
hydrogen</em>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_30" id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="label">[30]</a> "In addition to these four lamps, we learn from an Appendix
to his Paper in the Philosophical Transactions, that in the beginning
of his enquiries, he constructed a close lantern, which he
called the <em>Fire-valve lantern</em>; in which the candle or lamp burnt
with its full quantity of air, admitted from an aperture below, till
the air began to be mixed with fire-damp, when, as the fire-damp
increased the flame, a thermometrical spring at the top of the lantern,
made of brass and steel, riveted together, and in a curved
form, expanded, moved a valve in the chimney, diminished the circulation
of air, and extinguished the flame. He did not, however,
pursue this invention, after he had discovered the properties of the
fire-damp, on which his Safety-lamp is founded."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_31" id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="label">[31]</a> Whence he observes that, if it be necessary to be present in
a part of the mine where the fire-damp is explosive, for the purpose
of clearing the workings, taking away pillars of coal, or other objects,
the workmen may be safely lighted by a fire made of charcoal,
which burns without flame.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_32" id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="label">[32]</a> Mr. Tennant had, some years before, observed that mixtures
of the gas, from the distillation of coal, and air, would not explode
in very small tubes. Davy, however, was not aware of this at the
time of his researches.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_33" id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="label">[33]</a> The apertures in the gauze should not be more than one-twentieth
of an inch square. As the fire-damp is not inflamed by
ignited wire, the thickness of the wire is not of importance; but
wire from one-fortieth to one-sixtieth of an inch in diameter is the
most convenient.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_34" id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="label">[34]</a> M. de Humboldt conceived and executed the plan of a lamp
in 1796, for giving a safe light in mines, upon a similar principle
of entire insulation from the air.&mdash;<cite>Journal des Mines</cite>, t. viii. p. 839.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_35" id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35" class="label">[35]</a> "An Account of an Invention for giving Light in explosive
mixtures of Fire-damp in Coal Mines, by consuming the Fire-damp."
Read before the Royal Society, Jan. 11, 1816.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_36" id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="label">[36]</a> This principle has been applied for constructing what has been
termed the <em>Aphlogistic Lamp</em>, which is formed by placing a small
coil of platinum wire round the wick of a common spirit lamp.
When the lamp, after being lighted for a few moments, is blown
out, the platinum wire continues to glow for several hours, as long
as there is a supply of spirit of wine, and to give light enough to
read by; and sometimes the heat produced is sufficient to rekindle
the lamp spontaneously. The same phenomena are produced
by the vapour of camphor; and an aromatic fumigating
lamp has lately been advertised for sale, which is no other than
the contrivance above described; and it is evident that, if the
spirit be impregnated with fragrant principles, an aromatic vinegar
will be developed during its slow combustion, and diffused in
fumes through the apartment.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_37" id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="label">[37]</a> Sir Humphry Davy attempted to produce the phenomena
with various other metals, but he only succeeded with platinum
and palladium; these bodies have low conducting powers, and
small capacities for heat, in comparison with other metals, which
seem to be the causes of their producing, continuing, and rendering
sensible, these slow combustions.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_38" id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="label">[38]</a> A pamphlet appeared at Mons, in the year 1818, on the explosions
that occur in coal mines, and on the means of preventing
them by Davy's Safety-lamp. It was published under the direction
of the Chamber of Commerce and Manufactures of Mons,
accompanied by notes, and by the results of a series of experiments
that had been conducted by M. Gossart, President of the Chamber.
The province of Hainault is said to be richer in coal mines
than any other part of the Continent of Europe, and to have no
less than one hundred thousand persons employed in the working
them. The same kind of dangerous accidents occurred in these
mines as in those of the North of England, and various expedients
had been adopted for their prevention, which, however, availed
but little in obviating them. "All the precautions," observe the
reporters, "which had been hitherto known or practised, had not
been able to preserve the unfortunate miners from the terrible
effects of explosion. It is therefore an inappreciable benefit which
we confer by making known the equally simple and infallible
method of preventing these accidents, which has been discovered
by the celebrated Humphry Davy."</p>

<p>M. Gossart gives an ample and accurate detail of the properties
of the explosive gas, and confirms the truth of Davy's experiments,
by which the high temperature necessary for its inflammation,
and the consequent means of preventing it, by reducing that temperature,
as effected during its passage through wire-gauze, are
clearly demonstrated.</p>

<p>The lamp appears from this report to have been as useful in
the mines of Flanders as in those of England. The Pamphlet is
a valuable document, inasmuch as it affords an independent proof
of the security of the instrument, and displays the high sense of
obligation which foreign nations entertain to Sir Humphry Davy
for his invention.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_39" id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="label">[39]</a> The danger of carrying a naked light into an atmosphere impregnated
with the fumes of spirit was awfully exemplified by the
loss of the Kent East Indiaman, by fire, in the Bay of Biscay, on
the 1st of March 1825.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_40" id="Footnote_40" href="#FNanchor_40" class="label">[40]</a> In cases where there is any suspicion of accumulations of carburetted
hydrogen from the leakage of gas pipes, or from other
sources, the safety-lamp should always be employed. A terrible
accident occurred some years since at Woolwich, from a room
filled with the vapour of coal-tar, for the purpose of drying and
seasoning timber intended for ship-building. As the combustion
arose from the flame issuing through the flue, which ran along the
apartment, at the moment the damper was applied at the top of
the building, it is evident that, had a wire-gauze guard been used,
the accident could not have occurred. The house was completely
demolished, and nine persons were unfortunately killed.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_41" id="Footnote_41" href="#FNanchor_41" class="label">[41]</a> Granted:&mdash;but what connexion has that with the principle of
Davy's lamp, or with any <em>Safety</em> lamp?</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_42" id="Footnote_42" href="#FNanchor_42" class="label">[42]</a> It could not have been safe.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_43" id="Footnote_43" href="#FNanchor_43" class="label">[43]</a> "Tried"&mdash;but how was it tried?&mdash;by forcing in <em>pure</em> fire-damp,
which will extinguish any lamp, instead of exposing the
flame to an explosive mixture, which could alone furnish any test
of its security.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_44" id="Footnote_44" href="#FNanchor_44" class="label">[44]</a> Very likely: but the reader will please to recollect, that Sir
H. Davy had, before this, published an account of his principle of
safety by systems of tubes or canals.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_45" id="Footnote_45" href="#FNanchor_45" class="label">[45]</a> I have not thought it necessary to enumerate the various sums
which the different mines were called upon to contribute.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_46" id="Footnote_46" href="#FNanchor_46" class="label">[46]</a> It will be remembered that they resided together in the house
of Dr. Beddoes. See page 59, vol. i. of these memoirs. In the library

Mr. Poole to make enquiries.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_53" id="Footnote_53" href="#FNanchor_53" class="label">[53]</a> This theory of Davy is well illustrated by the change produced
in the flame of gas-light, when acted upon by the wind, as may be
seen during an illumination. The loss of light under these circumstances
evidently arises from the more rapid combustion of the gas,
by its more complete admixture with air; in consequence of which
the decomposition above described does not take place.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_54" id="Footnote_54" href="#FNanchor_54" class="label">[54]</a> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quere.</i> Is this theory correct? May not the effect be mechanical,
the appulse of the air separating the flame from the wick.&mdash;Upon
the principle suggested by Davy, how are we to explain the
fact of rekindling the flame by a blast?</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_55" id="Footnote_55" href="#FNanchor_55" class="label">[55]</a> "It is upon this principle that, in the Argand lamp, the Liverpool
lamp, and in the best fire-places, the increase of effect
does not merely depend upon the rapid current of air, but likewise
upon the heat preserved by the arrangement of the materials of
the chimney, and communicated to the matters entering into inflammation."
The art of making a good fire depends also upon
the same principle of economising the heat.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_56" id="Footnote_56" href="#FNanchor_56" class="label">[56]</a> From a calculation of the ratio in which the density of the atmosphere
decreases with its altitude, and from that of the relative
combustibility of different bodies, it follows that the taper would be
extinguished at a height of between nine and ten miles&mdash;hydrogen,
between twelve and thirteen&mdash;and sulphur, between fifteen and
sixteen.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_58" id="Footnote_58" href="#FNanchor_58" class="label">[58]</a> At the Anniversary of the Royal Society, November 1796,
Count Rumford transferred one thousand pounds, Three per Cent.
Consols, to the use of the Society, on condition that a premium
should be biennially awarded to the author of the most important
discovery, or useful invention, made known in any part of Europe
during the preceding two years, on the subject of <span class="smcap">Heat and
Light</span>. In regard to the form in which this premium was to be
conferred, he requested that it might always be given in two
medals, struck in the same die, the one of gold, and the other of
silver.</p>

<p>Should not any discovery or improvement be made during any
terms of years, he directed that the value of the medals should be
reserved, and being laid out in the purchase of additional stock,
go in augmentation of the capital of this premium.</p>

<p>Medals upon this foundation have been successively voted to
Professor Leslie, for his Experiments on Heat, published in his
work entitled "An Experimental Enquiry into the Nature and
Properties of Heat;"&mdash;To Mr. William Murdoch, for his publication
"On the Employment of Gas and Coal for the purpose of Illumination;"&mdash;to
M. Malus, for his discoveries of certain new properties
of reflected light;&mdash;to Dr. Wells, for his Essay on Dew;&mdash;to
Sir Humphry Davy, as above stated;&mdash;to Dr. Brewster, for his

<p><a name="Footnote_64" id="Footnote_64" href="#FNanchor_64" class="label">[64]</a> The Charter of the Royal Society states that it was established
for the improvement of <span class="smcap">NATURAL</span> science. This epithet "<i>natural</i>"
was originally intended to imply a meaning of which very few persons,
I believe, are aware. At the period of the establishment of
the Society, the arts of witchcraft and divination were very extensively
encouraged; and the word natural was therefore introduced,
in contradistinction to <i>super</i>-natural.</p>

<p>Although Sir Walter Scott, in his Demonology, alludes to the
influence of this Society in diminishing the reigning superstition,
he does not appear to have been acquainted with the circumstance
here alluded to.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_65" id="Footnote_65" href="#FNanchor_65" class="label">[65]</a> I state this opinion with the greater confidence, from a conviction
that it is not singular. On conversing lately upon the subject
with a gentleman to whom the Royal Society is deeply indebted
for the sound judgment and discretion he displayed on occasions
greatly affecting its interests, he replied, "Sir, we require not an
Achilles to fight our battles, but an Agamemnon to command the
Greeks."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_66" id="Footnote_66" href="#FNanchor_66" class="label">[66]</a> It was well known to his friends that, had his health not
declined, he would have carried into effect a reform which he
had long contemplated, and by which the Royal Society would
have become, at once, more dignified and more useful.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_67" id="Footnote_67" href="#FNanchor_67" class="label">[67]</a> Davy observes, that there are many facts recorded in the Philosophical
Transactions, which prove the magnetising powers of lightning:
one in particular, where a stroke of lightning passing through
a box of knives, rendered most of them powerful magnets.&mdash;<cite>Philosophical
Transactions</cite>, No. 157, p. 520, and No. 437, p. 57.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_68" id="Footnote_68" href="#FNanchor_68" class="label">[68]</a> The phenomena of many crystallized minerals which become
electric by heat, and develope opposite electric poles at their two
extremities, offered an analogy so striking to the polarity of the
magnet, that it seemed hardly possible to doubt a closer connection
of the two powers. The developement of a similar polarity in the
Voltaic pile pointed strongly to the same conclusion; and experiments
had even been made with a view to ascertain whether a pile
in a state of excitement might not manifest a disposition to place
itself in the magnetic meridian.&mdash;<cite>Herschel's Discourse</cite>, p. 340.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_69" id="Footnote_69" href="#FNanchor_69" class="label">[69]</a> The hypothesis was this:&mdash;"In galvanism, the force is more
<em>latent</em> than in electricity, and still more so in magnetism than in
galvanism; it is therefore necessary to try whether electricity, in
its <em>latent</em> state, will not affect the needle." This passage may be
thus explained: When the Voltaic circuit is interrupted, it possesses
opposite electrical poles; and when continuous, it no longer
affects the electrometer, or the electricity becomes <em>latent</em>, which is
the condition theoretically required for the manifestation of its magnetic
action: and the fundamental experiment of Oersted proved
that, under these circumstances, the compass needle was affected.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_70" id="Footnote_70" href="#FNanchor_70" class="label">[70]</a> Mr. Herschel, in speaking of the pertinacity with which Oersted
adhered to the idea of a necessary connection between electricity
and magnetism, observes, that there is something in it which reminds
us of the obstinate adherence of Columbus to his notion of
the necessary existence of the New World.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_71" id="Footnote_71" href="#FNanchor_71" class="label">[71]</a> For this discovery, the President and Council of the Royal
Society adjudged to M. Oersted the medal on Sir Godfrey Copley's
Donation for the year 1820.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_72" id="Footnote_72" href="#FNanchor_72" class="label">[72]</a> I find from a note addressed to Mr. Pepys, that on the 21st of
June, 1822, Davy worked the two batteries of 1000 plates each at
the London Institution, before the Prince Royal of Denmark. The
experiments were principally electro-magnetic.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_73" id="Footnote_73" href="#FNanchor_73" class="label">[73]</a> It would appear that M. Arago likewise discovered this fact at
about the same period; but it is evident that the French and English
philosophers arrived at the result independently of each other;
for the experiments which led to it were made by Sir H. Davy in
October 1820; while the September number of the "Annales de
Physique," containing the first account of the Researches of M.
Arago, was not received in London until the 24th of November in
that year; and it may be farther observed, that the numbers of this
journal were very commonly published several months after the
affixed date.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_74" id="Footnote_74" href="#FNanchor_74" class="label">[74]</a> M. Arago also, nearly at the same time, succeeded in communicating
magnetism to the needle; but, at the suggestion of M.
Ampère, it was effected in a different manner. A copper wire, by
being rolled round a solid rod, was twisted into a spiral, so as to
form a <em>helix</em>. It was easy, by passing the wire round the rod, in
one direction or the other, to form a <em>dextrorsal</em> helix, proceeding
from the right hand towards the left, as in the tendrils of many
plants; or a <em>sinistrorsal</em>, or left helix, proceeding downwards from
the left hand to the right above the axis. Into the cavity of a
spiral thus formed, connecting the two poles of a battery, a steel
needle wrapped in paper was introduced; and, in order to exclude
all influence of the magnetism of the earth, the conchoidal part of
the wire was kept constantly perpendicular to the magnetic meridian.
In a few minutes the needle had acquired a sufficiently
strong dose of magnetism; and the position of the north and south
poles exactly agreed with M. Ampère's notion, that the electric
current traverses the connecting wire in a direction from the zinc
extremity of the pile to the copper extremity.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_75" id="Footnote_75" href="#FNanchor_75" class="label">[75]</a> A very ingenious piece of apparatus was contrived to illustrate
this theory by experiment; but I am uncertain as to whom the
credit of it belongs. It consisted of a globe, containing metallic
wires, arranged in relation to each other according to the electro-magnetic
theory, when, by passing an electric current in the direction
of the ecliptic, the poles became magnetic.</p>

"there is water enough in the very crystals in my cabinet to extinguish
all the fires of the Plutonists."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_79" id="Footnote_79" href="#FNanchor_79" class="label">[79]</a> An explanation which the experiments of Mr. Faraday, on the
condensation of the gases, to be immediately described, will most
fully justify.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_80" id="Footnote_80" href="#FNanchor_80" class="label">[80]</a> Sir Humphry had expressed to me, on the preceding Thursday,
at the Royal Society, his wish to purchase the old house in
Penzance, which, as the reader will remember, was the early scene
of his chemical operations; and, at his request, I conversed with
Mr. Tonkin upon the subject; but it immediately appeared that
the interest which the Corporation of Penzance possessed in the
estate presented an insurmountable obstacle to the accomplishment
of his object.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_81" id="Footnote_81" href="#FNanchor_81" class="label">[81]</a> The results are contained in a short paper in the Quarterly
Journal of Science, vol. xv.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_82" id="Footnote_82" href="#FNanchor_82" class="label">[82]</a> I here allude to an anecdote related by Mr. Babbage, in his
"Reflections on the Decline of Science in England;" a work, by
the by, which strongly reminds me of a practical bull. A gentleman,
anxious to escape the tax on armorial bearings, wrote a long
letter to the Commissioners, stating I do not know how many reasons
to show that he could never have used them; and, after all,
sealed the letter with his own coat of arms! Had Mr. Babbage
hoped to convince the reader that Science was actually on the
decline in this country, he should never have written a work which
gives the lie to the title-page. Now for the anecdote.&mdash;"Meeting
Dr. Wollaston one morning in the shop of a bookseller, I proposed
this question: If two volumes of hydrogen and one of oxygen are
mixed together in a vessel, and if by mechanical pressure they can
be so condensed as to become of the same specific gravity of water,
will the gases, under these circumstances, unite and form water?
'What do you think they will do?' said Dr. W. I replied, that I
should rather expect they would unite. 'I see no reason to suppose
it,' said he. I then enquired whether he thought the experiment
worth making. He answered, that he did not, for that he
should think it would certainly <em>not</em> succeed.</p>

<p>"A few days after, I proposed the same question to Sir Humphry
Davy. He at once said, 'They will become water of course:' and
on my enquiring whether he thought the experiment worth making,
he observed that it was a good experiment, but one which it was
hardly necessary to make, as it must succeed.</p>

<p>"These were off-hand answers, which it might perhaps be hardly
fair to have recorded, had they been of persons of less eminent
talent; and it adds to the curiosity of the circumstance to mention,
that I believe Dr. Wollaston's reason for supposing no union would
take place, arose from the nature of the electrical relations of the
two gases remaining unchanged: an objection which did not weigh
with the philosopher whose discoveries had given birth to it."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_83" id="Footnote_83" href="#FNanchor_83" class="label">[83]</a> In the year 1812, Mr. Babbage attempted to ascertain whether
pressure would prevent decomposition: for this purpose, a hole
about thirty inches deep, and two inches in diameter, was bored
downward into a limestone rock, into which was then poured a
quantity of strong muriatic acid, and a conical wooden plug, that
had been previously soaked in tallow, was immediately driven hard
into the mouth of the hole. It was expected either that the decomposition
would be prevented, or that the gas developed would split
the rock by its expansive force: but nothing happened. Now, it
is most probable that a part of the carbonic acid had condensed
into a liquid, and thus prevented that developement of power
which Mr. Babbage had expected would have torn the rock
asunder.</p>

vapour, which would carry down sulphurous acid with it. It would
likewise assist by direct absorption. H. D.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_85" id="Footnote_85" href="#FNanchor_85" class="label">[85]</a> Mr. Knowles, in his "Inquiry into the Means which have
been taken to preserve the British Navy," observes, that the first
sheathing was probably the hides of animals covered with pitch,
or with asphaltum, which led to the use of thin boards, having, in
some cases, lime, and in others lime and hair, between them and
the bottom of the ships.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_86" id="Footnote_86" href="#FNanchor_86" class="label">[86]</a> The worms infesting the timber of ships are&mdash;the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Teredo</i>, the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lepisma</i>, and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pholas</i>. The first of these, however, which was
imported from India, is by far the most destructive; and I am
informed by Mr. Knowles, that it is more abundant at Plymouth
than on any other part of the coast where there is a dock-yard;
and although on the shores of England it is not of a very large size,
yet it is a formidable enemy to the safety of those ships which have
not a metallic sheathing to cover their bottoms. In the East Indies,
and off the coast of Africa, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Teredo</i> is of very large size;
and holes have been bored by them in the timber of at least seven-eighths
of an inch in diameter.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_88" id="Footnote_88" href="#FNanchor_88" class="label">[88]</a> In the year 1670, an Act of Parliament was passed, granting
unto Sir Philip Howard and Francis Watson, Esq. the sole use of
the manufacture of milled lead for sheathing ships; and, in the
year 1691, twenty ships had been sheathed with lead, manufactured
by them, and which was fastened with copper nails.&mdash;See <cite>Knowles's
Inquiry</cite>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_89" id="Footnote_89" href="#FNanchor_89" class="label">[89]</a> The copper sheathing was removed from this ship in 1763,
when all the iron was found to be much corroded, the pintles and
braces nearly eaten through, and the false keel lost, from the decay
of the keel staples and the bolt fastenings. Thus, in the very first
coppered ship, the Voltaic effect, produced by the contact of copper
and iron, was displayed in a very striking manner.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_90" id="Footnote_90" href="#FNanchor_90" class="label">[90]</a> An experiment was tried by painting or varnishing their inner
surfaces, but the use of brown paper which has been dipped in tar,
and placed between the wood and copper, is now considered to be
the best mode. A solution of caoutchouc spread on paper was
tried on the bottom of Sir W. Curtis's yacht; but, on examination,
it was pronounced to be less efficacious than tarred paper.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_91" id="Footnote_91" href="#FNanchor_91" class="label">[91]</a> In two instances, the copper (from the Batavier and from the
Plymouth yacht) which had remained perfect for twenty-seven
years, was found to be alloyed. In the former one there was an
alloy of one three-hundredth part of zinc; and, in the latter, the
same proportion of tin. On the other hand, in the case of the
copper on the Tartar's bottom, which was nearly destroyed in four
years, upon being submitted to chemical examination by Mr. Phillips,
it was found to be very pure copper.</p>

<p>Alloys of copper have generally been found more durable than
the unmixed metal; and various patents have been taken out for
the fabrication of such compounds; but metallic sheets so composed
have been found to be too hard and brittle, and not to admit
of that flexibility which is necessary for their application to a
curved surface; the consequence of which has been, that they
have cracked upon the ship's bottom.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_92" id="Footnote_92" href="#FNanchor_92" class="label">[92]</a> The Muriate of Magnesia is the most active salt in sea-water.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_93" id="Footnote_93" href="#FNanchor_93" class="label">[93]</a> During the course of some experiments in which I have been
lately engaged, a simple mode of exhibiting the principle of protection
occurred to me, which, I believe, has not before been suggested;
at least, I cannot find any notice of such an experiment.
As I consider it admirably calculated for illustration, I will here
describe it. Let two slips of copper of equal size, the one protected
with a piece of zinc, the other unprotected, be plunged into
two wine-glasses filled with a solution of ammonia. In a short
time, the liquor containing the unprotected copper will assume an
intensely blue colour; the other will remain colourless for any length
of time. The theory is obvious. When metallic copper is placed
in contact with an ammoniacal solution, a protoxide of the metal
is formed which is colourless,&mdash;and will remain so, if the contact of
air be prevented; but on exposure to the atmosphere, it passes
into a state of peroxide, which is dissolved by the ammonia, and
produces an intensely blue solution. In the case of the protected
copper, the metal is incapable of attracting a single atom of
oxygen, in consequence of having been rendered negative by the
zinc, and consequently no solution can take place.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_94" id="Footnote_94" href="#FNanchor_94" class="label">[94]</a> Amongst other counter-claims, there appeared, in a weekly
publication entitled "The Mechanic's Magazine," a statement in
favour of a person of the name of Wyatt, founded on the following
advertisement in "The World" newspaper of April 16, 1791. "By
the King's Patent, tinned copper sheets and pipes manufactured
and sold by Charles Wyatt of Birmingham. These sheets, amongst
other advantages, are particularly recommended for sheathing of
ships, as they possess all the good properties of copper, with others
obviously superior." It is unnecessary to observe that, except their
object, there is nothing in common in the inventions of Davy and
Wyatt. The superiority claimed by Wyatt consisted merely in
coating the copper with some substance less corrosive by sea-water
than that metal: an idea borrowed from the common practice
of tinning copper vessels.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_95" id="Footnote_95" href="#FNanchor_95" class="label">[95]</a> The rusting of a common piece of iron, if carefully inspected,
furnishes a beautiful illustration of this secondary action. The
oxide, at first a mere speck, and formed perhaps by a globule of
water, becomes negative with respect to the contiguous surface, and
by thus forming a Voltaic circuit, exalts its oxidability, and the rust
consequently extends in a circle.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_96" id="Footnote_96" href="#FNanchor_96" class="label">[96]</a> The Carnbrea Castle, a large vessel, of upwards of six hundred
and fifty tons, was furnished with four protectors, two on the stern,
and two on the bow, equal together to about 1-104th of the surface
of copper. She had been protected more than twelve months, and
had made the voyage to Calcutta and back. She came into the
river perfectly bright; and, when examined in the dry-dock, was
found entirely free from any adhesion, and offered a beautiful and
almost polished surface; and there seemed to be no greater wear
of copper than could be accounted for from mechanical causes.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_97" id="Footnote_97" href="#FNanchor_97" class="label">[97]</a> A common cause of adhesions of weeds or shell-fish, is the
oxide of iron formed and deposited round the protectors. In the
only experiment in which zinc has been employed for this purpose
in actual service, the ship returned after two voyages to the West
Indies, and one to Quebec, perfectly clean. The experiment was
made by Mr. Lawrence, of Lombard Street, who states that the
rudder, which was not protected, had corroded in the usual manner.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_98" id="Footnote_98" href="#FNanchor_98" class="label">[98]</a> The <em>poling</em> of copper is an operation, the theory of which is
involved in a great deal of mystery. Copper, when taken from the
smelting furnace, is what is termed <em>dry</em>, that is, it is brittle, has an
open grain and crystalline structure, and is of a purplish red colour.
The following is the process by which it is refined, or <em>toughened</em>, by
the process of <em>poling</em>. The surface of the melted metal in the furnace
is, in the first place, covered with charcoal. A pole, commonly
of birch, is then plunged into the liquid metal, which produces
a considerable ebullition from the evolution of gaseous
matter, and this operation is continued, fresh charcoal being occasionally
added, so that the surface may be always kept covered,
until the refiner judges from the assays that the metal is malleable.
The delicacy of the operation consists in the difficulty of hitting
the exact mark: if the surface should by accident be uncovered,
it will return to its <em>dry</em> state; and should the process be carried too
far, it will be <em>over-poled</em>, by which the metal would be rendered
even more brittle than when in a <em>dry</em> state. When this is found to
be the case, or, as they say, <em>gone too far</em>, the refiner directs the
charcoal to be drawn off from the surface of the metal, and the
copper to be exposed to the action of the air, by which means it is
again brought back to its <em>proper pitch</em>, that is, become again malleable.
Now the question is, what are the changes thus produced
in the copper? Is the metal in its <em>dry</em> state combined with a minute
portion of oxygen, of which <em>poling</em> deprives it, and thus renders
it malleable? and does the <em>over-poling</em> impart to it a minute
portion of carbon, and is copper, like iron, thus rendered brittle
both by oxygen and carbon? Or, is the effect of the pole merely
mechanical, that of closing the grain, and of altering the texture of
the metal? Something might be said in support of all these
opinions. Mr. Faraday, who has attentively examined the subject,
is unable to detect any chemical difference between <em>poled</em> and
<em>unpoled</em> copper. On the other hand, when the metal is <em>over-poled</em>,
it is found to oxidate more slowly, and its surface when in the furnace
is so free from oxidation, that it is like a mirror, and reflects
every brick in the roof. This certainly looks very much like carbonization.&mdash;See
"An Account of Smelting Copper, as conducted
at the Hafod Copper-works; by J. H. Vivian, Esq."&mdash;<cite>Annals of
Philosophy</cite>, vol. v. p. 113.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_99" id="Footnote_99" href="#FNanchor_99" class="label">[99]</a> This observation was suggested by an examination of a late
judgment of the Court of Common Pleas, in the case of Jones <i>v.</i>
Bright and others, on showing cause against rule for a new trial.
This was an action brought by the Plaintiff against the Defendants
for selling him copper, for the purpose of sheathing the ship Isabella,
which, from the rapidity of its corrosion, was inferred to have
an inherent defect in its composition. In this case it was held,
that with respect to <em>warranty</em>, there is a very wide difference as it
applies to articles which are not the subject of manufacture, and
those which are the produce of manufacture and of human industry.
In the one case, it may be that no prudence, no care, could
have guarded against a secret defect; in the other, by using due
care, and providing proper materials, any defect in the manufacture
may be guarded against. "In the case of the bowsprit, the man
did not make the timber which composed the bowsprit; he merely
cut it out, and fitted it to meet the purpose, and could therefore
by no means have guarded against the rottenness in the centre of
that bowsprit: but if a man makes copper, he may guard against
inherent defects in that copper, by taking care that the copper contains
a proper proportion of pure copper; and also by taking care
that it is so well manufactured, that it does not drink in a greater
quantity of oxygen than ought to be admitted into it, and that that
oxygen, which of necessity gets in, (for some will,) shall be so distributed,
that it shall not operate, as in the opinion of an intelligent
witness the oxygen in this case did operate, by forming itself
in patches, and thereby rendering it soft, and rendering the copper
incapable of resisting the influence of salt-water&mdash;that he can
guard against." With all due deference to the learned Judge,
suppose it be shown that no human wisdom can guard against
those circumstances by which a portion of the copper surface may
be rendered more highly electro-positive, what becomes of the
judgment? That the decay of copper sheathing is effected by extrinsic
causes, and does not necessarily depend upon an inherent
defect in the metal, may be proved in numerous ways. If it were
owing to the quality of the copper, why should five, ten, or twenty
sheets out of a hundred, made from the same charge of metal in a
furnace and manufactured under precisely similar circumstances,
be affected, and the remainder be perfectly sound? Why, again,
should sheets, made from several distinct charges, placed on a particular
vessel, be acted upon, while the same copper on other
bottoms is not more than usually dissolved? Did any inherent
defect exist in the metal, it surely must have equally affected the
whole batch.</p>

<p>It is possible that, in some cases, in consequence of the sheets
not having been properly cleansed before they are rolled, a portion
of the oxide may be pressed into them by the rollers. In such a
case, a Voltaic effect might be produced, and portions of the
metallic surface rendered more electro-positive.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_100" id="Footnote_100" href="#FNanchor_100" class="label">[100]</a> In the year 1825, His Majesty George IV. communicated to
the Royal Society, through Mr. Peel, his intention to found two
gold medals, of the value of fifty guineas each, to be awarded
annually by the Council of the Royal Society, in such a manner
as shall, by the excitement of competition among men of science,
seem best calculated to promote the object for which the Royal
Society was instituted.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_101" id="Footnote_101" href="#FNanchor_101" class="label">[101]</a> Numerous are the instances of later date which might be adduced
in illustration of the same fact; and it is now generally supposed
that it may have been a frequent cause of ships foundering
at sea. By oxidation, the volume of the iron at first increases, and
then diminishes; in consequence of which the ship leaks, or, to use
a technical expression, becomes "<em>bolt sick</em>." When the Salvador
del Mundo was docked at Plymouth, in February 1815, the iron
fastenings were in such a state of corrosion, that five planks near
the bilge dropped into the dock when the water left her.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_103" id="Footnote_103" href="#FNanchor_103" class="label">[103]</a> As far as the principle of Voltaic protection goes, this may be
very true; but it must be remembered that the acid generally present
upon these occasions is acetic acid, which rises in distillation
with water, so that at the boiling temperature it will be carried
beyond the sphere of Voltaic influence, and may thus act upon the
denuded copper as much as though tin were not present.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_104" id="Footnote_104" href="#FNanchor_104" class="label">[104]</a> There is an excellent example at this time in the London
Road leading to the Elephant-and-Castle.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_106" id="Footnote_106" href="#FNanchor_106" class="label">[106]</a> It would appear that Davy latterly preferred zinc to iron, as
the protecting metal. In a letter, dated October 1826, addressed
to a ship-owner, who had made some enquiries of him upon the
subject, he says&mdash;"The rust of iron, if a ship is becalmed, seems
to promote the adhesion of weeds; I should therefore always prefer
pieces of zinc, which may be very much smaller, and which, in the
cases I have heard of their being used, have had the best effect."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_107" id="Footnote_107" href="#FNanchor_107" class="label">[107]</a> In the Annals of Philosophy (vol. v.) may be found a paper
by Dr. Henry, on the conversion of cast iron pipes into plumbago.
This change appears to have been effected by the action of water containing
muriate of soda, and the muriates of lime and of magnesia.
Cast iron contains a considerable portion of carbon; the change is
therefore readily explained on the supposition of the removal of the
principal metallic part by these salts. The muriates of lime and
magnesia have been observed by Dr. Henry to discharge writing
ink from the labels of bottles, to which they had been accidentally
applied; and the same ingenious chemist has been baffled in his
attempts to restore the legibility of ink upon paper which had been
exposed to sea-water. The texture of the paper was not injured,
but the iron basis of the ink, as well as the gallic acid, was entirely
removed.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_108" id="Footnote_108" href="#FNanchor_108" class="label">[108]</a> His admiration of this work bursts forth in his <em>Salmonia</em>,
which he was writing at that time. He styles it "an immortal
monument raised by Genius to Valour."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_109" id="Footnote_109" href="#FNanchor_109" class="label">[109]</a> Mr. Children has just communicated to me the following
amusing anecdote, which may be adduced in illustration of the delight
he took in that sporting dexterity to which he alludes in the
above passage. Davy, with a party of friends, had been engaged for
several hours in fishing for pike, but very unsuccessfully; our philosopher
gave up the sport in despair, but his companions having
determined to try some more propitious spots, left him to his contemplations.
About an hour afterwards, Mr. Children, on returning
to his friend, saw him at a distance seated upon a gate, and
apparently lashing the air with his fishing-line. What could be his
object? As soon as Mr. Children came sufficiently near to make
a signal, Davy, by his gestures, earnestly entreated him to keep
away, while he continued his mysterious motions. At length, however,
Mr. Children's patience was exhausted, and he walked up to
him. "Was ever any thing more provoking!" exclaimed Davy; "if
you had only remained quiet another minute I should have caught
him&mdash;it is most vexatious!" "Caught what?" asked Mr. Children.
"A dragon-fly," (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Libellula</i>,) answered Davy. "During your absence
I have been greatly amused by watching the feeding habits of that
insect, and having observed the eagerness with which they snapped
up the little '<em>midges</em>,' I determined to arm my hook with one,
and I can assure you I have had no small degree of sport; and had
it not been for your unwelcome intrusion, I should most undoubtedly
have captured one of them."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_112" id="Footnote_112" href="#FNanchor_112" class="label">[112]</a> Davy might also have adduced an equally striking superstition,
in illustration of his subject, from the Cornish mines. The miners
not unfrequently hear the echo of their own pickaxes, which they
attribute to little fairies at work, and consider it as a happy omen.
They say upon such occasions, that there will be good luck, as the
Piskeys are at work. It is well known that the echo depends upon
some cavity in the vicinity of the workmen,&mdash;and a cavity, or
vogue, is always an indication of subterranean wealth.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_113" id="Footnote_113" href="#FNanchor_113" class="label">[113]</a> A pretended Mermaid was exhibited some time since in London,
said to have been caught in the Chinese seas. It was soon
discovered to have been manufactured by joining together the head
and bust of two different apes to the lower part of a kipper salmon,
which had the fleshy fin, and all the distinct characters of the
<em>Salmo Salar</em>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_114" id="Footnote_114" href="#FNanchor_114" class="label">[114]</a> See a Report of the President's speech, at the sixth anniversary
of the Mechanics' Institute, as reported in all the journals
of the day, December 5, 1829.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_115" id="Footnote_115" href="#FNanchor_115" class="label">[115]</a> "Vesuvius is a mountain admirably fitted, from its form and
situation, for experiments on the effect of its attraction on the
pendulum: and it would be easy in this way to determine the problem
of its cavities. On Etna the problem might be solved on a
larger scale."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_116" id="Footnote_116" href="#FNanchor_116" class="label">[116]</a> This is a question which Gibbon has very eloquently discussed
("<em>General Observations on the Fall of the Roman Empire in the
West</em>," vol. vi.) "Cannon and fortifications now form an impregnable
barrier against the Tartar horse; and Europe is secure from
any future irruption of barbarians; since, before they can conquer,
they must cease to be barbarous." What an extraordinary illustration
does this principle find in the history of our possessions in
India, where, to speak in round numbers, thirty thousand Europeans
keep no less than one hundred million of natives in subjection!</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_117" id="Footnote_117" href="#FNanchor_117" class="label">[117]</a> Under the article 'Sensation,' in the Philosophical Dictionary,
we find Voltaire indulging in a similar speculation. "It may be,
that in other globes the inhabitants possess sensations of which
we can form no idea. It is possible that the number of our senses
augments from globe to globe, and that an existence with innumerable
and perfect senses will be the final attainment of all being."</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_118" id="Footnote_118" href="#FNanchor_118" class="label">[118]</a> See page 287, vol. i. for an account of this event.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_119" id="Footnote_119" href="#FNanchor_119" class="label">[119]</a> See vol. i. page 70.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_120" id="Footnote_120" href="#FNanchor_120" class="label">[120]</a> In illustration of the pious custom here alluded to by Sir H.
Davy, it may be observed, that the vessels of the alchemists very
commonly bore some emblem; such, for instance, as that of the
cross; and from which, indeed, the word <em>crucible</em> derived its
appellation.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_121" id="Footnote_121" href="#FNanchor_121" class="label">[121]</a> In addition to the anecdote already related of him, the following
may serve to give a still greater force to this opinion. Soon
after the appearance of Mr. Cavendish's paper on hydrogen gas, in
which he made an approximation to the specific gravity of that
body, showing that it was at least ten times lighter than common
air, Dr. Black invited a party of his friends to supper, informing
them that he had a curiosity to show them. Dr. Hutton and
several others assembled, when, having the allentois of a calf filled
with hydrogen gas, upon setting it at liberty, it immediately ascended,
and adhered to the ceiling. The phenomenon was easily
accounted for: it was taken for granted that a small black thread
had been attached to the allentois,&mdash;that this thread passed
through the ceiling, and that some one in the apartment above, by
pulling the thread, elevated it to the ceiling, and kept it in that
position. This explanation was so probable, that it was acceded
to by the whole company; though, like many other plausible theories,
it was not true; for when the allentois was brought down, no
thread whatever was found attached to it. Dr. Black explained
the cause of the ascent to his admiring friends; but such was his
unaccountable apathy, that he never gave the least account of this
curious experiment even to his class; and more than twelve years
elapsed before this obvious property of hydrogen gas was applied
to the elevation of air balloons, by M. Charles, in Paris.</p>

<p>I am indebted for this anecdote to the "History of Chemistry,"
a very able work by Dr. Thomson, constituting the third
number of the National Library.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_122" id="Footnote_122" href="#FNanchor_122" class="label">[122]</a> "Reflections on the Decline of Science in England," page 15.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_123" id="Footnote_123" href="#FNanchor_123" class="label">[123]</a> While upon this subject, it is impossible not to notice the discoveries
of Dr. Franklin, who combined in a remarkable degree a
fertile imagination with a solid judgment; and the fruit of this
union is to be seen in the invention of conductors for the security
of ships and buildings against the effects of lightning. The philosopher
who, predicating the identity of lightning and electricity,
conceived the bold and grand idea of drawing it down from the
thunder-cloud, an experiment which in another age would have
consigned him to the dungeon for impiety, or to the stake for
witchcraft, himself applied this wonderful discovery to the preservation
of buildings, by the invention of pointed rods of iron.
Of this invention it may be truly said, that he beat Nature with
her own weapons, and triumphed over her power by an obedience
to her own laws.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_124" id="Footnote_124" href="#FNanchor_124" class="label">[124]</a> Sir Humphry Davy has told us an anecdote which well illustrates
this observation, while it affords a gratifying testimony of
the kind feeling he entertained towards a kindred philosopher.&mdash;"There
was&mdash;alas! that I must say <em>there was!</em>&mdash;an illustrious philosopher,
who was nearly of the age of fifty before he made angling
a pursuit, yet he became a distinguished fly-fisher, and the
amusement occupied many of his leisure hours, during the last
twelve years of his life. He indeed applied his preeminent acuteness,
his science, and his philosophy, to aid the resources and exalt
the pleasures of this amusement. I remember to have seen Dr.
Wollaston, a few days after he had become a fly-fisher, carrying at
his button-hole a piece of Indian rubber, when by passing his silkworm
link through a fissure in the middle, he rendered it straight,
and fit for immediate use. Many other anglers will remember
other ingenious devices of my admirable and ever-to-be-lamented
friend."&mdash;<i>Salmonia. Additional Note</i>, Edit. 2.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_125" id="Footnote_125" href="#FNanchor_125" class="label">[125]</a> Mr. Babbage considers it as a great mistake to suppose that
Dr. Wollaston's microscopic accuracy depended upon the extraordinary
acuteness of the bodily senses; a circumstance, he says,
which, if it were true, would add but little to his philosophical character.
He is inclined to view it in a far different light, and to see
in it one of the natural results of the precision of his knowledge
and of the admirable training of his intellectual faculties.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_126" id="Footnote_126" href="#FNanchor_126" class="label">[126]</a> This inestimable man died on his plantation at Nevis, on the

<p><a name="Footnote_133" id="Footnote_133" href="#FNanchor_133" class="label">[133]</a> Lavoisier perished on the scaffold at the age of fifty-one,
during the sanguinary reign of Robespierre. The fury of the revolutionary
leaders of France was particularly directed against the
farmers-general of the revenue, who were all executed, with the
exception of a single individual, a M. de Verdun. Sixty of them were
guillotined at the same time, in consequence of a report of Dupin,
a frantic member of the Convention. The revolutionary tribunal
adopted a general formula, as the ground of their condemnation,
which is curious as applied to Lavoisier, who was declared guilty
of having "adulterated snuff with water and ingredients destructive
of the health of the citizens." The unfortunate philosopher
requested time to complete some experiments on respiration. The
reply of Coffinhal, the President, was, that "the Republic did not
want savans or chemists, and that the course of justice could not
be suspended."</p>
